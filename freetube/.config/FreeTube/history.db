On top of these baked in window managers, you have tiling window managers.\n\nStuff like i3, hyprland, sway, awesomeWM, BSPWM, XMonad, qtile, ratpoison and a lot more.\n\nSome are manual tilers, some are dynamic. Dynamic tilers will open each new window following something YOU defined.\n\nBasically, you have plenty of choice, but tiling window managers will replace your current desktop with something that is more meant to be used with a keyboard, without much user input, to maximize the use of your screen real estate. So, let&apos;s look at why you&apos;d want to use a tiling window manager.\n\n\nThe first, obvious advantage is that you never get anything overlapping anything else, unless you actively choose to do so. On a regular desktop, you&apos;ll have to move windows out of the way, or minimize them, or resize them, and this is basically wasted time; it&apos;s time not spent using the computer and accomplishing something.\n\nThe second advantage is that it sort of removes the need to use the mouse or the touchpad 99% of the time. The only time you&apos;ll probably need to use it is to interact with the contents of the window itself, like clicking a link in the web browser, or clicking a button in a window.\n\nAnother advantage is resource usage. A tiling window manager generally doesn&apos;t bring with it a whole system of panels, overviews, app grid, menus, effects and more, meaning that you don&apos;t load as many things in memory as with a complete desktop.\n\nA big advantage is also screen usage: without a big panel and a dock, tiling windows always uses the most space available on your screen.\n\nSo, with so many advantages, why wouldn&apos;t I use a tiling window manager?\n\nMost desktops already give me enough of the tiling features to suit my use case. Using KDE, or GNOME, I can already tile my windows if I want to. I can drag them to any corner or edge and have them use that screen size. In KDE, I even have a full tiling manager that I never use because I don&apos;t need it.\n\nSure, this edge tiling doesn&apos;t give you as much flexibility as a full tiling window manager, but for me personally, it&apos;s more than enough. And it all comes down to my use case: I make videos.\n\nWhich means I have 2 modes: research / writing mode, and video editing mode. In the first, I need 2 windows: A browser for research, and QOwnNotes to write. Sometimes, I&apos;ll use a virtual machine as well, but tiling this on a laptop display doesn&apos;t make sense, so I open it full screen on a virtual desktop.\n\nIn editing mode, I have my video editor, Davinci Resolve, in full screen. Again, not something a tiling WM would help me with.\n\nMy panel autohides behind windows, so it doesn&apos;t take up space, and while I do have title bars, I also don&apos;t have gaps between my windows when they&apos;re tiled, or between a window and a screen edge, so I&apos;m actually pretty sure it&apos;s the exact same screen space usage.\n\nI also don&apos;t lose out on configuration, at least on KDE: I can change all these shortcuts, I can change how windows open by default, they remember their previous size, it works. And finally, most of the time, I work on a laptop. It&apos;s a 16 inch screen, but it&apos;s still a laptop. And tiling there is just completely inefficient and makes things way too small.\n\nWhat I&apos;m saying is that yes, a tiling window manager is really useful, and cool, but it&apos;s NOT for every use case and every user.","viewCount":135154,"lengthSeconds":1015,"watchProgress":885.185606,"timeWatched":1712353834825,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"03r6ZktqaTbxe8E9"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":2209,"lengthSeconds":144,"watchProgress":143.57,"timeWatched":1738006808535,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"1SXuOlq0Y5sCRV0z","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

The following are the commands to change to Vi-bindings (and back to Emacs-bindings).\n\nBASH: set -o vi (set -o emacs)\nZSH : bindkey -v (bindkey -e)\nFISH : fish_vi_key_bindings (fish_default_key_bindings)\n\nThe following commands were shown in this video.  Listed are the Emacs-bindings followed by the Vim-bindings in parentheses:\n\nCTRL-a (0 or ^) jump to beginning of line\nCTRL-e ($) jump to end of line\n\nCTRL-f (h) move forward one char\nCTRL-b (l) move backward one char\n\nALT-f (w) move forward one word\nALT-b (b) move backward one word\n2w, 2b...in Vi-mode\n\nCTRL-k (d$) delete from this point to the end of the line\nCTRL-u (d0) delete from beginning of the line to this point\nCTRL-y (u) undo\n\nCTRL-w (db) delete a word backwards\nALT-d  (dw) delete a word forwards\n\nAlt-. to past last command argument\nOr just type !!, !$ in the command line\n\nCTRL-p (k) move to prev command in history\nCTRL-n (j) move to next command in history\n\nCTRL-l to clear terminal\nCTRL-d to exit the shell\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n💰 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n💳 Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=derek%40distrotube%2ecom&lc=US&item_name=DistroTube&no_note=0&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHostedGuest\n🛍️ Amazon: https://amzn.to/2RotFFi\n👕 Teespring: https://teespring.com/stores/distrotube\n\nDONATE CRYPTO:\n💰 Bitcoin: 1Mp6ebz5bNcjNFW7XWHVht36SkiLoxPKoX\n🐶 Dogecoin: D5fpRD1JRoBFPDXSBocRTp8W9uKzfwLFAu\n📕 LBC: bMfA2c3zmcLxPCpyPcrykLvMhZ7A5mQuhJ\n\nDT ON THE WEB:\n🕸️ Website: http://distrotube.com/\n📁 GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1  \n🗨️ Mastodon: https://fosstodon.org/@distrotube\n👫 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/\n📽️ LBRY/Odysee: https://odysee.com/@DistroTube:2\n\nFREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT I USE:\n🌐 Brave Browser - https://brave.com/dis872 \n📽️ Open Broadcaster Software: https://obsproject.com/\n🎬 Kdenlive: https://kdenlive.org/\n🎨 GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/\n💻 VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/\n🗒️ Doom Emacs: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs\n\nYour support is very much appreciated.

Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":23290,"lengthSeconds":207,"watchProgress":203.174868,"timeWatched":1737103200420,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"2StaUv0zlCdrgm8R","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}
{"videoId":"a7iMgZQlfAE","title":"\"My Parents\" - Lewis Black | Thanks For Risking Your Life","author":"Lewis Black","authorId":"UC3FbbI6zNALJhHAhwOJhEyg","published":1726772400000,"description":"No matter how old you get, you are still your parent&apos;s child.\n\n&quot;Thanks For Risking Your Life&quot;\nLewis Black, heir to the George Carlin throne of the comedy rant, and practitioner of his signature blend of frustrated optimism, lets loose again on his familiar punching bags of hypocrites, corporate swindlers, and governmental incompetents. Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

That&apos;s just part of the story. If what you dislike is Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, then disabling this doesn&apos;t really help.\n\nAnd we&apos;ll begin by immediately lying, as this one isn&apos;t Ubuntu based: it&apos;s actually the one Ubuntu is based on: Debian. If what you like about Ubuntu, and what you want to keep using, is apt, the package manager, the vast software repos, but you want a vanilla KDE or GNOME experience, and none of the Canonical projects and decisions, Debian might be a really solid bet.\n\nMint is based on the latest Ubuntu LTS, and removes basically everything that makes Ubuntu, Ubuntu: snaps aren&apos;t there, some apps that don&apos;t have a debian package anymore in Ubuntu have on in Mint, like Chromium, and they don&apos;t use the GNOME desktop: you get Cinnamon, a desktop Mint developed themselves, once based on GNOME 3, but now pretty much its own thing.\n\nOne you might want to try is Rhino Linux. It&apos;s also a relatively recent distro, and it moves away from the Ubuntu template by being a rolling release: it doesn&apos;t give you major upgrades, it&apos;s always updated in the background, especially the Linux kernel, and some important apps, like Firefox.\n\nRhino Linux doesn&apos;t use the GNOME desktop by default, it uses its own vision of XFCE, that, let&apos;s be honest, feels very much like modern GNOME. You can use apt, but Rhino Linux also comes with a meta package manager, called Rhino-pkg, that lets you install debian packages from the repos, flatpaks, snaps, and it also lets you use pacstall, an equivalent to the Arch User repository for Ubuntu.\n\nAnother Ubuntu based distro that has a few cool tricks up its sleeve is PopOS.  PopOS has some updates on top of that base, notably for drivers and the Linux kernel, and has some applications that are provided in their own repo, so you&apos;re not stuck on very old versions of important apps. They also have some interesting tweaks to the GNOME desktop: they offer a different experience, with a dock by default, an app launcher, and auto tiling features that let you switch from floating windows to a tiling window manager at the press of a button, or with a keyboard shortcut.\n\nIf you&apos;re more of a KDE user, then there&apos;s Tuxedo OS. It&apos;s Ubuntu based, with the latest KDE apps and desktop, plucked straight from KDE Neon&apos;s repositories: this means you get a semi rolling release model, with access to the repos for Ubuntu&apos;s latest LTS version, plus some extra repos on top of that for more recent kernel and drivers, and some applications that need to be more up to date.\n\nAnd now for a list of the distros I didn&apos;t really include, and the reasons why!\n\nThe first one is Zorin OS: while it&apos;s a good take on Ubuntu, being basically exactly Ubuntu LTS, but with a customized desktop, pre made layouts, and support for virtually every packaging format out of the box, it&apos;s also based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and the Linux kernel 5.15.\n\nThe second one is elementary OS. It&apos;s based on 22.04 LTS, and does have access to the full Ubuntu repos. While I personally think it&apos;s a really great option, the defaults won&apos;t fit everyone, including the removal of all debian based packages from their graphical app store.\n\nAnd then there are all the Ubuntu flavours: they&apos;re also now constrained by Canonical&apos;s decisions, like preventing them from shipping another packaging format than snap.","viewCount":148857,"lengthSeconds":986,"watchProgress":870.524788,"timeWatched":1709765818890,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"2o27XIAAOZ6PlVd1"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":57493,"lengthSeconds":88,"watchProgress":83.878497,"timeWatched":1737274980983,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"3ijz6UNpfBIel2tU","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":93792,"lengthSeconds":198,"watchProgress":198.143986,"timeWatched":1737117857124,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"4I4cLAvRafDUt6o1","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":41565,"lengthSeconds":127,"watchProgress":124.811307,"timeWatched":1737099713505,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"5lrGwicVDOzM35oo","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

{"videoId":"JcSCXa8J2pY","title":"How to Use SSH to Connect to a Remote Server in Linux | Step-by-Step Guide","author":"ProgrammingKnowledge2","authorId":"UC8aFE06Cti9OnQcKpl6rDvQ","published":1724523531000,"description":"Welcome to our channel! In this video, we’ll show you how to use SSH (Secure Shell) to connect to a remote server in Linux. SSH is a powerful tool that allows you to securely access and manage remote servers from your local machine. Whether you’re a system administrator managing servers or a developer accessing your web server, this tutorial will provide you with all the knowledge you need to use SSH effectively.\n\n<b>*Why Use SSH to Connect to a Remote Server?*</b>\n\nSSH is an essential tool for anyone who needs to manage remote servers securely. It encrypts your connection, ensuring that all data transmitted between your local machine and the remote server is protected from unauthorized access. SSH is commonly used for tasks like managing files, running commands, monitoring server performance, and more, all from the comfort of your local terminal.\n\n<b>*What You’ll Learn:*</b>\n\n- <b>*What is SSH?*</b> We’ll begin by explaining what SSH is and why it’s used. You’ll learn about the basics of SSH, including how it works and why it’s the standard for secure remote server management.\n\n- <b>*Installing SSH Client:*</b> If your Linux distribution doesn’t have SSH installed by default, we’ll show you how to install the SSH client on your system using package managers like `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`. We’ll also cover how to ensure the SSH service is running on your server.\n\n- <b>*Basic SSH Command Structure:*</b> Next, we’ll dive into the basic structure of the SSH command. You’ll learn how to initiate an SSH connection using the `ssh` command followed by the username and the IP address or domain name of the remote server.\n\n- <b>*Connecting to a Remote Server:*</b> We’ll guide you through the process of connecting to a remote server. You’ll see how to enter your credentials securely, and we’ll explain how to recognize and respond to the server’s host key to establish a trusted connection.\n\n- <b>*Using SSH Keys for Authentication:*</b> To make your connections more secure and convenient, we’ll show you how to generate and use SSH keys for passwordless authentication. You’ll learn how to create a key pair with `ssh-keygen`, copy your public key to the remote server, and configure SSH to use keys instead of passwords.\n\n- <b>*Transferring Files with SCP and SFTP:*</b> We’ll also introduce you to `scp` and `sftp`, two powerful tools that allow you to transfer files between your local machine and the remote server securely using SSH. You’ll learn how to use these tools to upload and download files easily.\n\n- <b>*Running Remote Commands with SSH:*</b> We’ll show you how to execute commands on the remote server directly from your local terminal using SSH. This is useful for quickly running scripts, monitoring system status, or managing files without logging into the server.\n\n- <b>*Advanced SSH Tips:*</b> Finally, we’ll cover some advanced SSH features, such as tunneling, port forwarding, and configuring SSH for specific use cases. These tips will help you get the most out of SSH for your specific needs.\n\n<b>*Key Features:*</b>\n\n- <b>*Comprehensive Guide:*</b> This tutorial covers everything you need to know about using SSH in Linux, from basic connections to advanced features.\n  \n- <b>*Practical Examples:*</b> We provide real-world examples to help you understand how to apply what you’ve learned, ensuring you can use SSH effectively in your own projects or work.\n  \n- <b>*Security Best Practices:*</b> Learn how to make your SSH connections more secure with tips on using SSH keys, configuring SSH options, and avoiding common security pitfalls.\n\nMake sure to watch the full video to become proficient in using SSH to connect to remote servers in Linux. Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more Linux tutorials and tech content!\n\n<b>*Helpful Resources:*</b>\n\n- OpenSSH Documentation: [OpenSSH Guide](https://www.openssh.com/manual.html)\n- SSH Key Management: [SSH Keygen Manual](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen)\n- SCP Command Guide: [Using SCP](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/)\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to leave a comment below, and we’ll be happy to help you out!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/ssh\">#SSH</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linux\">#Linux</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/remoteserver\">#RemoteServer</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/secureshell\">#SecureShell</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxcommands\">#LinuxCommands</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/servermanagement\">#ServerManagement</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/sshkeys\">#SSHKeys</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/scp\">#SCP</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/sftp\">#SFTP</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxforbeginners\">#LinuxForBeginners</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/techtutorial\">#TechTutorial</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/systemadministration\">#SystemAdministration</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/opensource\">#OpenSource</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxsecurity\">#LinuxSecurity</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/remoteaccess\">#RemoteAccess</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxguide\">#LinuxGuide</a>","viewCount":219,"lengthSeconds":813,"watchProgress":14.898724,"timeWatched":1724669832764,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"6KY5yrOzXfJomMRK","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

I was left surprised by the high quality computing experience that this distro provides. Really, LMDE is carving its own place in the Linux world and it’s definitely here to stay.\nI’ve been playing with LMDE 6 for some time now to see how it performs as my main system. I was really anticipated to see how LMDE 6 compares against other top distros, especially my main Linux Mint system, and LMDE came out with flying colors. Really, in certain areas, this is even better than the main Linux Mint. And very honestly, LMDE 6 is strong contender for the throne of the best Linux distro in 2023.\nSo I’m thrilled to bring LMDE 6 to you today.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":33615,"lengthSeconds":96,"watchProgress":91.856514,"timeWatched":1737275135622,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"7pxJToSNeZyyA0eo","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member.

The &quot;middle of the road&quot; answer, being &quot;I understand how things wok, but I&apos;m no expert&quot; gathered 40% of answers, and only 10% of answers in total described themselves as what I&apos;d call beginners, with 9% saying they had a lot to learn, and 1% saying it was a brand new world.\n\nSo, what is difficult to accomplish on Linux? What seems to be the most annoying thing to deal with is integrating Linux systems with other devices, 36% of people picked this as a pain point.\n\nThe second big pain point is &quot;using existing hardware&quot;, 28% of people picked this as a problem, and finding compatible hardware was a problem for 24% of people.\n\nInterestingly, installing Linux was not picked as a pain point, only 4% of people said it was a problem.\n\nMost people who answered have experiences hardware issues on Linux. 44% said they had a problem they could fix, and 36% said they had an issue they couldn&apos;t solve.\n\nIn terms of the main problematic components, there were a few surprises here. First are GPUs: 34% of people said they had trouble with their GPU.\n\nAlso a surprise: gaming controllers and peripherals: 9% of people who answered said they had troubles here. Wifi and Bluetooth at 17% each are sort of surprising to me as well, I thought this was a thing of the past, but apparently not.\n\nNow, as per software related problems, here again, Linux has issues. 48% of people who answered said they faced a software problem they could fix, and 35% said they faced one they couldn&apos;t solve. Only 14% said they didn&apos;t face any software related problems.\n\nAs per the problematic categories, the biggest offender is sleep / wake and suspend, 30% of answers pointed that as a problem. App compatibility is also a big issue, 29% of people said Linux wasn&apos;t a supported platform for the software they needed to use.\nGaming is a sore spot, with 27% of people answering they&apos;re facing problems there.\n\nSo, 37% of people who answered said they could do most of what they wanted, but not everything. 33% said they could do everything, but some things were harder than on other platforms.\n26% said they could do everything they wanted on Linux, and only 4% in total said many or most things they needed to do weren&apos;t possible on Linux.\n\nAs per the general experience of using Linux, most people seem to feel their system is very reliable: 56% said they have a few issues that don&apos;t impact their trust in their OS, 38% said they didn&apos;t worry about stability at all, and only 6% in total said they had frequent issues that make them lose trust in Linux as their OS.\n\n71% of people who answered also said their experience with Linux was very good, better than other operating systems, and 6% said it was perfect without issues.\n16% said it was good, and on par with other operating systems, and 6% in total said their experience was bad or very bad, as in worse than other OSes to downright unusable.\n\nMost people also felt they absolutely needed the command line to fix problems on their systems. 50% said they had to use it a bit, and 28% said it was mandatory to get a usable system. Only 23% said they didn&apos;t need to use the command line at all.","viewCount":14056,"lengthSeconds":1232,"watchProgress":1118.850883,"timeWatched":1717095803589,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"8UFg3ulzfw3qacZP"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":301628,"lengthSeconds":118,"watchProgress":118.002,"timeWatched":1737109161487,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"9ssCy38IpjOS6NqU","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This operating system is called Debian. Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel. Linux is a completely free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 50,000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) - all of it free. It&apos;s a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian -- carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together. \nHomepage: https://www.debian.org/\nDownload: https://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist\n\n#<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/additional\">#additional</a> programs to install\nopenbox\ntint2\nobconf\nfeh\nnemo\ngedit\nxterm\nlxterminal\nlightdm\nlightdm-gtk-greeter\nyad\nscreen\nrofi\nvolumeicon-alsa\nlxpolkit\nnano\nfirefox\ncelluloid\ngimp\nlxappearance\nlibreoffice\nhtop\nneofetch\nengrampa\n\n\n#<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/edit\">#edit</a> lightdm.conf\ncd ..\nsu\n#<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/enter\">#enter</a> password\nnano etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n#<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/uncomment\">#uncomment</a> the following\npam-service=lightdm\npam-autologin-service=lightdm-autologin\nautologin-user=yourusername\nautologin-user-timeout=0\n#<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/hit\">#hit</a> ctrl+o to write then ctrl+x to save\nexit #<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/to\">#to</a> exit su\n\ncd ..\ncd home/username/.config\nmkdir openbox\ncd openbox\nnano autostart\n\n#<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/add\">#add</a> the following to autostart then hit ctrl+o to write then ctrl+x to save\nlxpolkit &amp;\nxrandr -s 1920x1080 &amp;\nxrandr --dpi 92 &amp;\nxrandr --dpi 92 &amp;\ntint2 &amp;\nvolumeicon &amp;\n#<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/after\">#after</a> you boot into the system and fix your screen resolution with arandr and add a wallpaper with nitrogen, add the following to autostart\nnitrogen --restore &amp;\n\n#<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/rofi\">#rofi</a>\nrofi -show drun -show-icons\n\n#<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/calendar\">#calendar</a>/logout session manager\nyad --button --undecorated --skip-taskbar --timeout=&quot;15&quot; --timeout-indicator=&quot;top&quot; --calendar --button=&quot;Cancel:1&quot; --button=&quot;Restart:systemctl reboot&quot; --button=&quot;Shutdown:systemctl poweroff&quot; --button=&quot;Logout:killall openbox&quot;\n\n++++++--------///////////////Audio Credits///////////////---------+++++++\n\n\n\nChanges by Purrple Cat | https://purrplecat.com/\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US\n\nMahogany by Filo Starquez | https://soundcloud.com/filo-starquez\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported (CC BY-ND 3.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/\n\nSmall Town Boy by | e s c p | https://escp-music.bandcamp.com/\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nForest by | e s c p | https://escp-music.bandcamp.com/\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nSmall Town Girl by | e s c p | https://escp-music.bandcamp.com/\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nBirdhouse by Purrple Cat | https://purrplecat.com/\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US\n\nEarly Bird by | e s c p | https://escp-music.bandcamp.com/\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nPlease, Don’t Forget Me by | e s c p | https://escp-music.bandcamp.com/\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nI Miss You, Southern Winds by | e s c p | https://escp-music.bandcamp.com/\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nWinter Morning by Purrple Cat | https://purrplecat.com/\nMusic promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\nCreative Commons / Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US","viewCount":1710,"lengthSeconds":1487,"watchProgress":47.425984,"timeWatched":1712435812543,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"A9XCOCOyjWboTtRF"}

It lets you search files extremely fast using their names, but it can also look through command history, processes, bookmarks, git commits, and more.\n\nATUIN thing replaces your shell history with a database you can search through super easily. Once it&apos;s installed with brew, press the up arrow key or control +r, and you&apos;ll get a search interface to look for all your commands.\n\nCHEZMOI lets you manage your dotfiles. It lets you share these config files across devices by syncing them to a got repo, and it can interface with a very large variety of password managers to keep everything safe.\n\nIf you use a laptop, and you find Linux&apos;s batter life to be a bit subpar,  maybe look at POWERTOP.\nJust run the command powertop, and you&apos;ll see all processes. Using tab, you can navigate to various statistics, but also to the &quot;tunables&quot; screen, which will show you what powertop identifies as a bad configuration for battery life.\n\nIf you&apos;d like to tune these, you can rune powertop --auto-tune, and it will change all the settings to what it believes are &quot;good&quot; options for battery life saving, although it might impact the performance.\n\n\nIf you&apos;d like to quickly analyze what uses a lot of disk space on your computer, or on a remote server, you might want to replace the du and df commands with DUST.\n\nIf you run a dual boot, and you&apos;re facing problems with accessing one of your installed systems, you can force GRUB to reboot into a specific system, just for the next boot, using the grub-reboot command, followed by the number of the grub entry for that system.\n\nIf you need to monitor for resource usage on your computer, you might be using top, or htop, but BTOP is a better option. It looks better than htop or top, and it&apos;s also more legible.\n\nIf you often use the cat command to read a file, maybe try BAT instead. It does the same thing, but it also has syntax highlighting for a bunch of files, and it communicates with git to show modifications in files, with the usual Plus and minuses symbols.\n\nIf man is too much for you and is too much reading, and if the --help option isn&apos;t enough, why not try TLDR? It gives you an abridged version of the contents of MAN for most of the available programs and commands, and it makes things more legible, and easier to parse at a glance.\n\nIf you like to split a terminal or a tty into multiple terminals, ZELLIJ is a nice alternative to things like tmux. It&apos;s basically a tiling window manager for your terminal workspace: you can define your own layout, it supports plugins, floating panes, and more.\n\nYou can run it by running the zellij command, and then you can create a new pane pressing alt + N, you can move a pane using control +h, or make it floating with Control + P, then W.\n\nIf you often use ls to list files in a directory, you might want to take a look at EZA. It does the same job, as in, it lists the contents of a directory, but it does it with way more details, and a more legible interface.","viewCount":18416,"lengthSeconds":984,"watchProgress":923.777497,"timeWatched":1709069755424,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"ATtemEabmJcpbxYa"}

Dunham brings back all of his beloved puppet characters, including the grumpy old man Walter, the redneck Bubba J, the pepper on a stick Peanut, and the purple-skinned woozle Peanut. Throughout the special, Dunham and his puppet pals tackle a variety of topics with their signature irreverent humor. Walter delves into his tumultuous relationship with his wife and shares his unfiltered opinions on the government. Bubba J, with his Southern charm and love for beer, likely brings his unique perspective to current events and pop culture.\n\nSubscribe for More Comedy: https://tinyurl.com/laughsociety\n\nAs a special treat for fans, country music superstar Brad Paisley makes a guest appearance during the show. While the audience may be excited to see Paisley, Dunham jokingly suggests that the real stars of the show are Walter and Bubba J, and that the audience is primarily there to see their favorite puppet characters rather than the country singer. &quot;Unhinged in Hollywood&quot; promises to deliver Jeff Dunham&apos;s trademark blend of ventriloquism, comedic timing, and biting social commentary, all while showcasing the iconic characters that have made him one of the most successful comedians of his generation.

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

Its 16.1 inches with a 2K resolution of 2560x1440, so it&apos;s 16:9, better for gaming IMO than 16:10, but less good for other tasks.\n\nIt has a full aluminium chassis, an 80Wh battery, it can accomodate up to 96 gigs of RAM, 8 terabytes of PCIe 4 SSD, and it comes with USB 4, the latest HDMI 2.1 and Wifi 6E. But what matters is what&apos;s inside, and that&apos;s a ryzen 7 7840HS, and a radeon 7600M XT, with 8 gigs of DDR6 VRAM.\nThe aluminium chassis really feels solid, and the whole laptop is pretty hefty, at 2.2 kilos, or 4.8 pounds.\n\nThe CPU is a ryzen 7 7840HS, it&apos;s 8 cores, 16 threads, running at a top speed of 5.1Ghz. In geekbench 6, it got 2640 in single core, and 12635 in multi core, so it&apos;s more powerful than the i7 13700H I use daily on my own laptop.\n\nbrowser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/5180453\n\nIn terms of gaming, I ran the benchmark for horizon zero dawn.\nAt the native resolution and max settings, the game got 77 FPS, perfectly playable with a very nice looking experience.\nLowering that 1080p and using FSR on the quality setting, still at the max settings, I got 116 FPS.\nAnd at high details, 1080p with FSR on the quality settings, you reach 118 FPS, so you’ll be able to make use of that displays high refresh rate!\n\n\nAnd all of this runs in hybrid graphics mode by default, at least on the preinstalled Tuxedo OS my review unit came with.  \n\nThe laptop, running at half brightness with wifi on, playing videos in a loop, lasted for 6 hours.\n\n\nOn the left side, you have a USB 1 3.2 Gen 2 port, a headphone jack, and a separate mic jack. On the right, you have a fingerprint reader, which unfortunately, doesn&apos;t support Linux.\n\nYou also get a USB C port, 4.0 Gen 3x2, it supports power delivery and displayport 1.4, and it&apos;s hardwired to the integrated GPU, and on the right, you also have another USB A 3.2 Gen2.\n\nOn the back, you get a barrel charger, a gigabit ethernet port, an HDMI 2.1 port that supports freesync and is hardwired to the dedicated GPU, and a USB C 3.2 Gen 2x1 port, that supports display port, freesync, and is hardwired to the dedicated GPU as well.\n\n\nThe display can run up to 165hz, but can go down to 120, 96, 72 or 69hz. Viewing angles are perfect, and it covers 100% of sRGB, with a contrast ratio of 1000:1. it&apos;s 300 nits of brightness which isn&apos;t bad but it isn&apos;t the birghtest ever, and it supports AMD Freesync. It&apos;s 2K, so 2560 by 1440p.\n\nThe keyboard is a rubber membrane affair, that feels really good to type on. it&apos;s quiet, key travel is ok the keys don&apos;t get stuck they&apos;re stable, so you can press from a corner and activate them, and you get a numpad which is a personel preference. You also get a tux branded key, full size arrow keys that are slightly off compared to the rest of the keyboard, which I hated at first, but kinda like now, because it makes them really easy to find.\nThey keyboard is RGB backlit, you can control that in the tuxedo control center, to change the color and the brightness to anything you like, or you can press function + space bar to turn it on or off.\n\nThe touchpad is really smooth and sturdy, it&apos;s big enough, it&apos;s really off center though, which some people like, but I don&apos;t, I like things centered. It produces a very reassuring solid click, it doesn&apos;t rattle at all, it&apos;s really nice, and works with gestures as well.\n\n\nThe Sirius 16 comes with 4 speakers, which sound really nice. The mic is nothing to write home about, it&apos;s ok for small chats. As per the webcam, it goes up to 1080p 30, which isn&apos;t bad, and it doesn&apos;t yield horrible results at all.","viewCount":7652,"lengthSeconds":873,"watchProgress":809.093529,"timeWatched":1709842224449,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"BymoLxMVq05j57Ee"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":42467,"lengthSeconds":146,"watchProgress":141.850944,"timeWatched":1737100133123,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"C5n7lXqPRCtXhwyi","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Picking up where he left off with the Grammy-nominated Thanks For Risking Your Life. This time Lewis has the view of someone who spent entirely too much time in isolation during the Pandemic, where the irksome details of life drew his acute attention. As the world shut down in the spring of 2020, Lewis went on a quarantine-tinged journey of self-discovery which led him to many personal revelations, including that he is old, that solitary confinement is a punishment, and that all recipes are made for a happy family of four, and most importantly, never look directly in a cat’s eyes.\n\nDespite the trials of quarantine, Lewis’ feisty streak has not faded. In the “new” normal, he is quick to acknowledge that he’s feeling a significant level of frustration at the thought of creating comedy in a world where the reality of events exists only in the minds of the viewers. His job now is to nightly counteract the daily narratives presented by the former president, the current Ghost of Christmas Past, and the conspiracy theorists and Walmart shoppers who span the political and social spectrum.\n\nRecorded Live at The Paramount Theater, Huntington, New York in May 2022.\n\n__\n\nChapters: \n0:00 - Intro \n1:39 - Great Expectations \n3:13 - You Didn&apos;t Do Your Homework \n7:50 - One Hundred and Three \n10:48 - Shutdown \n14:34 - Provisions \n17:45 - Should Have Been A Peacock \n23:58 - Somebody F’ed A WHATTTTT!!??!! \n26:54 - Solitary Confinement \n36:57 - &quot;Cats&quot; \n40:40 - A Mask Is A Mask \n44:22 - To Vax Or Not To Vax \n51:15 - Cray-Cray \n55:13 - Companionship \n\n__\n\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by: Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by: Jack Gulick and Benjamin Brewer\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nLighting Director: John Finen\nEdited By: Derek Ambrosi\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nAudio Recording Engineer: Philip Shipman - The Sound Co-Op\nSound Edit &amp; Re-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nColorist: Dave Colonna\nScreen Art: Sam Black\n\n__\n\n“Tragically, I Need You” is available for purchase Digitally (May 2nd) and on CD (June 9th)\nDigital release: https://lnk.fu.ga/lewisblack_tragicallyineedyou\nCD Release: https://tinyurl.com/LewisBlackCD\n\n—\n\nFOLLOW LEWIS\nOfficial Website: http://www.lewisblack.com/\nTour &amp; Tickets: http://www.lewisblack.com/tickets\n\nLewis Black’s Rantcast (podcast): https://thelaughbutton.podlink.to/Rantcast \nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thelewisblack\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/thelewisblack\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thelewisblack\nTikTok: http://www.tiktok.com/@thelewisblack \nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/officiallewisblack\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/standupcomedy\">#standupcomedy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/comedy\">#comedy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/lewisblack\">#lewisblack</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/tragicallyineedyou\">#tragicallyIneedyou</a>\n\n©2023 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc.

(De Wikipedia)\n\nADVERTENCIA:  Instalo las últimas versiones de Wayland y Wayland-protocols que ni siquiera están en los repos de Debian Sid al momento de hacer esta prueba.  Estoy creando un &quot;Franken Debian&quot;.\n\nInstalado en un Portatil Compaq CQ45 - Debian GNU/Linux 12 - Bookworm 64 Bits con Escritorio GNOME.  Tenía activado los repositorios main contrib no-free non-free-firmware y los repos proposed-updates.  Todo apuntando a bookworm.\n\nEn su página oficial dice que Hyprland necesita varias dependencias con las últimas versiones de los paquetes así que se pueden presentar problemas graves si se sigue este procedimiento :-)\n\nDe la wiki de Hyprland:\n&quot;... Arch, NixOS and openSUSE Tumbleweed are very supported. For any other distro (not based on Arch/Nix) you might have varying amounts of success. However, since Hyprland is extremely bleeding-edge, distros like Pop!_OS, Ubuntu, etc. might have major issues running Hyprland.&quot;\n\nAdicional, lo instalé en máquina virtual pero no funciona.  Sigo probando;  tal vez sea porque mi equipo es muy limitado para virtualizarlo o me falta configurar bien la Aceleración 3D :-(\n\n\n❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️\nSi deseas apoyarme puedes unirte al Canal de &quot;Linux en Casa&quot;\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFnFYB2mWAdVwA7Q94AaLPA/join\nTambién puedes dejar una Donación a través de los ❤️ Super Gracias y Super Chats ❤️ \nPor supuesto también puedes dejar un &quot;Me Gusta&quot; , un Comentario y ver uno que otro anuncio.\n\n¡Gracias por tu apoyo!\n❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️\n\nNOTAS ADICIONALES:\nEmpiezo con un sistema con GNOME y GDM.  GDM es compatible con Hyprland.  \nEn el minuto 02:35 hay 2 opciones, un script o seguir las instrucciones.  Al intentar el script da error por eso estoy siguiendo los comandos uno por uno.\n\nMinuto 05:50  no encontré hwdata-dev, instalo hwdata. \n\nMinuto 09:28  al comando de la página ---  tar -xzvJf....   le sobra la z\n\nMinuto 11:20  voy dando los comandos uno por uno y no con el doble ampersand.\n\nMinuto 15:20 debí instalar la versión libliftoff que descago e instalo en el minuto 24:50  y no la versión de los repos oficiales.  Aunque al final nunca la instalo, solamente doy los comandos con meson y ninja pero no instalo la version libliftoff 4 en el sistema.  Sigo buscando como hacerlo.\n\nMinuto 19:40 se instala libwlroots-dev solo para que se instalen las dependencias, de lo contrario al instalar hyprland da error. Por eso veo la pestaña 1 y luego vuelvo a la pestaña 2 en 21:50.\n\nMinuto 28:00 reinicio solo por la mala constumbre :-(\n\nMinuto 28:35  funciona solo que falta instalar el emulador de terminal kitty; así que vuelvo a abrir GNOME para instalarlo.\n\nMinuto 32:24   el ritual de neofetch con Hyprlad.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/hyprland\">#hyprland</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/debian\">#debian</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/bookworm\">#bookworm</a>","viewCount":3458,"lengthSeconds":2016,"watchProgress":25.531694,"timeWatched":1712176639438,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"CjA94SCo717iC4Cn"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":59549,"lengthSeconds":157,"watchProgress":155.152233,"timeWatched":1737118064874,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"CwxC4sTpJldlxraU","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

I&apos;ll be installing vanilla Arch on a Thinkpad, and explaining exactly what each step does along the way.\n\nFollow-up vid - configuring your new Arch installation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-puvglgx6Qs&t=0s\n\nThis video covers:\n0:00 What are we doing today?\n1:23 Why Arch?\n5:37 Flashing the Arch ISO\n9:40 Booting the live environment, checking system type, basic configuration\n22:23 Partitioning your disks\n33:48 Installing essential packages and chrooting into the system\n37:50 Final configuration and bootloader installation\n47:25 Arch is installed!\n\nAs well as:\nBasic/new-user friendly command line and vim usage\nBasic explanation of partitions and the root filesytem\nExplanation along the way to make sure you understand what is happening at each step.\n\nIf anything is unclear or wrong, let me know in a comment, and I will make note of that in the description. I highly recommend following along on the Arch Linux official installation guide.\n\nI will create a follow-up video about how to configure your system following a basic Arch install.\n\nI am performing a BIOS install with an unmounted bios-boot partition, so if you are on a UEFI system, the following changes are necessary: \n\n1. Instead of creating a BIOS boot partition, create an EFI system partition. Make this a 2GB partition, with type EF00.\n2. When formatting the partition, use command mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1\n3. When mounting other partitions, also mount your EFI partition, after making a directory /mnt/boot for it.\n4. When generating an fstab file, ensure that your EFI partition is included in the output file.\n5. Before installing GRUB, install efibootmgr with pacman (pacman -S efibootmgr).\n6. When installing the GRUB bootloader, use the command grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB\n\nLastly, if you are installing Arch alongside another OS:\nCreate the new Linux partitions in free space without removing the old, however if you are on UEFI and already have an EFI partition, do not make a new one, instead just mount that one. Before rebooting, while chrooted in, install the package os-prober, and run the command os-prober as root to detect and generate a boot entry. If you have a Windows installation alongside Linux, make sure you have fast-boot disabled.","viewCount":9863,"lengthSeconds":2966,"watchProgress":366.862499,"timeWatched":1732483137534,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"DDFSZVnvHNugbQ6y","lastViewedPlaylistId":"favorites","lastViewedPlaylistType":"user","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":"955178d4-9d4c-4014-acad-9a9d1759a44e"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":39367,"lengthSeconds":72,"watchProgress":72.332,"timeWatched":1737104445252,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"DLiPuECvx9T9NP2r","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

We also have Sway, at 12%, i3 at 11%, and then a smattering of others, like AwesomeWM, bspwm, qtile, xmonad and more.\n\nSpeaking of which: Wayland got 66% of answers here, versus 34% for X11.\n\nAs per hardware, I asked people which kind of GPU and CPU they used. For CPUs, AMD and Intel are really evenly matched, at 50% for AMD and 49% for Intel, the last % being for ARM based CPUs. \n\nAs per GPUs, AMD takes the lead here, but not by much, we get to 39% of answers.\n\n22% of people who answered only have an Nvidia GPU, so that&apos;s still pretty high, and if we add Nvidia GPUs as a hybrid configuration in a laptop, we land on 37%.\n\nPure Intel configurations, represent 22% of answers for integrated graphics, and 1% for dedicated Intel only, plus another % for people who run a hybrid config with a dedicated Intel GPU, so at most 24%.\n\nAs per the provenance of that hardware, a lot of people seem to build their own computers to run Linux on, at 44%. 40% of people who took the survey bought a PC from a major window manufacturer, with WIndows preinstalled, or no OS if the option was available.\n\nApart from that, only 4% said they used a computer from a Linux manufacturer, like TUxedo, System76, Slimbook, and the like, 2% use a mac, and, interestingly, 5% bought a computer from a major manufacturer with Linux preinstalled, so presumably from Dell or Lenovo, as these are the 2 main ones that have the option, AFAIK.\n\n\nI paired that question with another one, asking how well Linux ran on people&apos;s computers, and overwhelmingly, it seems that hardware compatibility is great these days. 63% of respondents said they experienced 0 issues after installing Linux, and 23% said they did have small problems that they could fix. Only 13% said there&apos;s still hardware that doesn&apos;t work at all, and 1% said their computer performs pretty badly under Linux.\n\n66% of people who answered use flatpaks mixed in with packages from other sources, and 6% only use this format, meaning we&apos;re at almost 3/4 of respondants that use Flatpaks daily.\n\nThe results are not as positive for other formats, with Snaps not being used at all by 84% of people who answered, and 54% of people not using APpImages at all.\n\nOn the topic of applications, Firefox seems to be the asbolute most poplar browser here, at 68%, with an extra 9% for Firefox derivatives like Librewolf.","viewCount":28989,"lengthSeconds":1319,"watchProgress":1167.124777,"timeWatched":1712269807811,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"EpFMBPUGX3oqHgka"}

He questions the rationale, or lack of, behind some of the things we say to each other and life for deceased parents in heaven or hell.\n\nIt’s Bad For Ya, Carlin¹s Emmy-nominated 14th and final HBO special from March of 2008 features Carlin¹s noted irreverent and unapologetic observations on topics ranging from death, religion, bureaucracy, patriotism, overprotected children and big business to the pungent examinations of modern language and the decrepit state of the American culture. Carlin once again comes up with an hour of brand new material that not only makes you laugh, but makes you think.\n\nStream the full special here: https://tubitv.com/movies/499791/george-carlin-it-s-bad-for-ya\n\nGeorge Carlin described his comedy as focusing on 3 things: love of language and how we use it; the small things, moments we all share as humans; and the big topics of our culture—war, death, children, religion, etc. A social commentator, he challenged conventional wisdom and brought us face-to-face with our ingrained hypocrisies. There was no topic off limits to his keen observation, wordplay, goofy jabs and rants, whether it was drugs, war, politics, the accumulation of stuff or the way in which we use words.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/georgecarlin\">#georgecarlin</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/standupcomedy\">#standupcomedy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/death\">#death</a>","viewCount":239290,"lengthSeconds":593,"watchProgress":593.235,"timeWatched":1735054154367,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"GmvCWYfeBy6Ah2Yg","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":20033,"lengthSeconds":91,"watchProgress":88.307054,"timeWatched":1737100759690,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"L5QmHWuvpFvtyWMi","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Perfect timing. So while her friends used the time to get sober or get fit, Kelsey spent the pandemic getting used to divorced life. The Highs: peeing in the shower without her husband&apos;s judgement. The lows: watching ASMR videos on YouTube to feel less alone. Lucky for us, she wrote jokes about all of it. So now we can hear about it in her hilarious new hour, The Hustler.\n\nIn Kelsey reflects on love and sex with the detached wisdom of a guru. She wonders if her marriage was doomed from the start, given that her husband had to give up peanut butter when they got together because of her severe allergy. She talks about the rush she gets from hustling drunk guys in bars who don&apos;t know she&apos;s a world-champion foosball player.\n\nShot in the beloved Comedy Works in Denver, Colorado and directed by Eric Abrams, creator of This is Not Happening on Comedy Central, Kelsey delivers an hour of sharply-observed comedy that speaks directly to anyone who&apos;s lved, lost or woken up in Vegas without a shred of dignity left\n\nDownload and stream Kelsey’s new album ‘The Hustler’ on all your favorite services: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TheHustlerID\n\nFollow Kelsey Cook at… \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kelseycookcomedy/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@kelseycookcomedy\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@KelseyCookComedy\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/KelseyCookComedy\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KelseyCook\n\nCredits \nWritten &amp; Performed by Kelsey Cook \nDirected by Eric Abrams \nExecutive Producers: Ian Adkins, Ryan Bitzer, Damion Greiman, Anthony Leo, Lisa Mierke, Chelsea Connors\nProduced by Matt Schuer\nLine Producer: Laura Velez\nAssociate Producers: Marc Atkinson &amp; John Beckwith \nDirector of Photography: Sean Emer \nEdited by Dan Cotter \nPost Production: Supervisor Marc Atkinson \nSound Recordist: Anthony Leo \nFOH Sound: Bronco Papagiorgio \nSound Mixer: Tyler Whitlatch \nColorist: Andrew Finch \nDIT: Marc Atkinson \nMakeup Artist: Allison Pynn\nStill Photographer: Andrew Max Levy \nOpening Comedian: Tommy Schneeman \nCamera Operators: Brody Nadeau, Chris Roe, Justin Groom, Ray Dellacroce \nFirst Assistant Camera: Partick Varga &amp; Adam Monroe \nGaffer: Eric Fulcher \nGrip: Clayton Cantrell \nProduction Assistants: Abby Pellien &amp; Sydney Powell \n\nFilmed at Comedy Works in Downtown Denver \n\n© 2023 800 Pound Gorilla Pictures, All Rights Reserved\n\nA Special Thanks to Wede Curtis, Jeff Fisher, Ashley Chapa, Lisa Mierke, Chelsea Connors, Matt Blake, Matt Frost, Eric Abrams, Tommy Schneeman, Chris Cook, Kathi Cook, Jennifer Nickel, Allison Pynn, Andrew Max Levy, Taylor Tomlinson, Chad Daniels, Jim Norton, The Entire 800 Pound Gorilla Team, and The Entire Staff at Comedy Works\n\nDedicated to my mom, Kathy.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":11701,"lengthSeconds":86,"watchProgress":82.166862,"timeWatched":1737275233882,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"M5KCtZIVB6cBffdD","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":11285,"lengthSeconds":160,"watchProgress":159.869388,"timeWatched":1737118226936,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"N8sBFiGvLrB6tW3p","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

The calm relaxing tantric music releases the blocks in your body that slow down the sexual energy flow and suppress the suppress the ultimate tantric experience. The tantric vibrations liberate the sexual energy from your Sacral Chakra and make every spot on your skin as sensitive to touch as your genital area. Imagine what a sexual act would feel if your whole body would respond to contact as your genitals.\n\nAgain, the key is the relaxation. The composition is over an hour long, therefor you have enough time for preparing to the final body merging in a sacred tantric sexual act. Help your partner to dissolve in warm vibration by performing a slow and sensual massage, preferably with aromatic oils. Touch the body of your special one gently and tenderly in a random manner and start feeling the mutual sexual excitement. If needed you can loop this composition and let it play while your sexual contact lasts.\n\nThe tantric sexuality music for full body culmination is unisex. It stimulates both man an women. The subliminal frequencies awaken and liberate both the masculine sexuality and the feminine sexuality. The deep tantric vibrations help these energies to find each other and merge in one together as long as your full bodies and genitals are merging together.\n\nThe healthy sexual life is essential for the well being of every human. The suppressed and unmanifested sexual energy can be harmful in a long run. Therefor, stop holding yourself back, open up before your partner and let both of you share your secret desires. Let go of prejudice and be truthful in what you want to experience. Manifest you true sexuality and allow each other to live through the liberating and healing sexual self-expression.\n\nComposition number: 22048","viewCount":767701,"lengthSeconds":3765,"watchProgress":22.155743,"timeWatched":1708985873987,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"NPwHfPIcNkCjOlWc"}

Most feature live music performances broadcast on television in San Diego CA, though there are also rarely seen commercials, comedy clips, and other material that doesn&apos;t seem to be anywhere else on Youtube or online. Most of the tapes were recorded on a Sony SL-HFT7 Super Beta Theater Hi-Fi Stereo - the same model was refurbished and is being used for these digital transfers and uploads. \n\nIn rare occasions where a BetaGems clip does appear elsewhere, we&apos;re only uploading if our own beta master is better quality or contains material not seen previously. Much footage comes from public television and public access broadcasts that the taper, who worked for a local cable TV production company in the 1980s, monitored nightly for several years. Some of the programming is strictly regional, mostly from the San Diego area.","viewCount":137775,"lengthSeconds":641,"watchProgress":635.632692,"timeWatched":1737036007718,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"R31leCtXpEJUO8J7","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":15729,"lengthSeconds":100,"watchProgress":97.668767,"timeWatched":1737275721485,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"RX2u6Q27QuTW1oyZ","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

When you install a window manager like i3 or hyprland (which is what I’m using here). You get almost no extra tools whatsoever on top of the tiling window experience. You don’t typically get an application launcher, or a terminal, or literally any nice-to-have tool really. think of things you would NEED like a lockscreen, system idling, all of that stuff.","viewCount":8776,"lengthSeconds":781,"watchProgress":0.832619,"timeWatched":1729712660810,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"RzM2RxFSsNyk2EcD","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

It adds features not found in regular Fedora, like WINE dependencies, OBS Studio, third-party codec packages for GStreamer, NVIDIA drivers, and package fixes. The main goal of Nobara is to fix issues and provide an improved out-of-the-box experience for gaming, streaming, and content creation.\n\nNobara comes in three flavors: Official, GNOME, and KDE. The difference between the Official ISO and the GNOME ISO is that the &apos;Official&apos; version has pre-enabled extensions for a different cosmetic look. Other than the choice of desktop environment (GNOME with extensions, pure GNOME, and KDE), all three variants have identical packages. The Official ISO is designed for people who appreciate GNOME’s functionality but prefer KDE’s layout. If you prefer to customize your GNOME experience, I recommend using the GNOME ISO instead of the Official ISO.\n\nDownload Nobara: \nhttps://nobaraproject.org/\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n0:00 ᓇ : Prarambh\n0:42 ArcMenu\n2:11 System Apps\n3:37 System Settings (Gnome 44.3)\n5:18 System Utilities\n6:00 Tweaks (Customizing Options)\n7:37 Nobara Desktop Layouts\n9:09 Bottom Panel \n11:15 Terminate 🔚\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n\n🎵 Track Info:\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nView by Ametryo   / ametryo  \nCreative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported — CC BY-SA 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: https://bit.ly/View-Ametryo\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxF-ck4DAEQ&t=0s\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n&amp;&amp;\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nSkydancer by Scandinavianz   / scandinavianz  \nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: https://bit.ly/_skydancer\nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp-eibuQpWg&t=0s \n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linux\">#linux</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/nobaralinux\">#nobaralinux</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/ubuntu\">#ubuntu</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/gnome\">#gnome</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/kdeplasma\">#kdeplasma</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxcustomization\">#linuxcustomization</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/gnomecustomization\">#gnomecustomization</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/gnome45\">#gnome45</a>","viewCount":2238,"lengthSeconds":690,"watchProgress":155.411587,"timeWatched":1712085818968,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"S3OHQO0CDJghc107"}

And that Wayland support is pretty flawless in my experience.\n\nAnd this release also brings a few cool things, courtesy of Wayland: HDR is now supported, provided your display also support it. You can also set a color profile for each display individually, on Wayland as well. And finally, you also get color blindness correction filters in the settings.\n\nFirst, the theme is now lighter on the eyes. They have removed a bunch of the blue borders that every single panel inside of an app had, so the whole feel of the desktop is similar, but also nicer, you don&apos;t have that many lines that draw your eyes. Highlighted items in list views are also different, now with rounded corners and a little bit of spacing.\n\nAnother visual change is the floating panel by default.\n\nThe defaults have changed drastically First, single click to select is now the default, with double click to open. Tap to click on touchpads is also the default now,  and they&apos;ve disabled scrolling on the desktop to switch workspaces.\n\nIt&apos;s now way easier to change panel configuration. The previous messy pop-up was replaced by something much more visual, which will absolutely be a better experience. You get visual representations of the settings you&apos;re changing, with combo boxes to select what you want, and tou can now auto hide the panel.\n\n\nAnother big change is the combination of the overview and the present windows effect. It feels like the older overview, except, it looks a lot like GNOME&apos;s. What has changed is the touchpad gestures, and these are much, much better. You also get the desktop cube back.\n\nAnother change is the ability to just click inside of a scrollbar&apos;s area to move the content directly to that area. Finally, Krunner got faster, way faster, and now lets you reorder the various elements that it shows when you search for something.\n\nVisually, the settings are less busy. Gone are the double rows of icons at the bottom of a page, they now mostly moved to the toolbar of the settings app, meaning that settings pages now look a bit nicer. They&apos;ve also reduced the number of pages that were opened by clicking a button inside of another page, so things are easier to find, and the settings were reordered into other categories.\n\nYou get a new sound theme preference page, and, easier configuration of which app will open a broad category of file.\n\nDolphin received changes to its settings as well, reordering a bunch of things, and it gained kjeyboard shortcuts to access the toolbar buttons and the disk space usage bar that lives in the status bar. You can also now right click a folder to open it in split view.\n\nSpectacle, the screen recorder,  now shows a tray icon when it&apos;s recording your screen, you can click it to end the recording. It also support recording a part of your screen, and has new keyboard shortcuts to handle all of this. Everything will now be saved by default in the pictures  screenshots directory, you can change that of course. It also support VP9 to record videos, and can be used using the CLI\n\nKonsole has redesigned settings, and will use less ram. Text selection now works for chinese, korean or japanese, and every tab now uses a separate cgroup, meaning the entire app will no longer be killed if your system needs to kill a process to save somle resources","viewCount":133230,"lengthSeconds":1226,"watchProgress":287.930578,"timeWatched":1709846290333,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"SJt2U9SLvSSreelF"}

For many, many Linux distros, SystemD is this init system.\n\nSYstem D is a relatively recent project, at the scale of Linux anyway, it started in 2010, and was spearheaded by Red Hat. Its goal was to replace the existing solutions, like SysV or Upstart, to make things faster and more resilient.\n\nIt quickly became the default on Fedora, obviously, then on Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE, and many, many others. \n\nThe famous Bloat argument is one advanced most often. System D, as time went on, encompassed more and more features that were generally handled by individual services, not the init system itself, like device management, login, or network management and creating logs.\n\nThis can be perceived as going against the Unix philosophy, where a piece of software is supposed to do just one thing, and to communicate well with other small systems. \n\nWhat&apos;s certain is that most distros that implement it are general purpose distros, that need to provide as many systems as possible, and so they tend to use most of systemD&apos;s features and modules.\n\nSystemD also &quot;hides away&quot; certain configurations with its own tools, like systemctl, instead of exposing everything as a config file. Whether these things are important or not, though, depend on the person. \n\nAnother criticism levelled at System D is the fact that it has become so pervasive that a lot of other components are created with a hard dependency on it: without SystemD, they can&apos;t work at all, or will have a limited featureset. This results in some extra work for distros that don&apos;t want to use systemD, as they have to use an alternative implementation of these features.\n\nAnother regular criticism of SystemD comes from the fact it&apos;s mainly a Red Hat project, or at least was started by Red Hat. The fact remains that while systemD was started at Red Hat, it IS an open source project, and it is receiving contributions from a lot of people that aren&apos;t at Red hat.\n\nAnother criticism of SystemD is that it&apos;s making Linux based systems uniform and that it restricts choice. I&apos;d argue this isn&apos;t really true, since there ARE other alternatives, like OpenRC, Dinit, SysVInit and more.\n\nOne final problem people identify with SystemD is system security. First, there&apos;s the fact that having one single system that powers the init and service management of most distros is a security risk: an attacker can target many, many systems by targeting systemD.\n\nSecond, some people would say that since SystemD is huge and does a lot of things, it has a very large attack surface.\n\nBut why would you WANT to use it, exactly?\n\nSystemD is a unified project, which means you don&apos;t have to learn 20 different programs if you need to interact with something: you learn how systemD works, and you can manage everything.\n\nCompared to other init systems, it&apos;s also simpler, as it opens various sockets that services can plug into, and services can start in mostly any order. And finally, systemD is written in C, and isn&apos;t the usual compilation of bash scripts, so it tends to be faster and more efficient than many other init systems.","viewCount":116464,"lengthSeconds":959,"watchProgress":401.118683,"timeWatched":1715450163906,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"SMxjHHenkggpm45b"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":9193,"lengthSeconds":107,"watchProgress":106.449,"timeWatched":1737105053658,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"SrmbRb8tpCZ91Hc6","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

From the elaborate instructions on how to use a seatbelt to whether you should get in or on the plane, nothing escapes his comedic observation.\n\nWhen George Carlin is asked which HBO concert is his favorite, his answer is always, “Jammin’ In New York.” The reasons are several: It was his first HBO show done live; it was the first he had done in his hometown, New York City; and it was the largest audience he had ever worked before: 6,500. But Carlin says it also represented a newfound sophistication in his writing. “It was the first time I had done truly extended pieces consisting of separate sections all flowing together. It was a big leap for me.”\n\nThe show, taped at the Paramount Theater in Madison Square Garden and winner of the 1992 CableACE Award, is a perfect blend of biting social commentary and more gently-observed observational pieces.\n\nStream the full special here: https://tubitv.com/movies/503294/george-carlin-jammin-in-new-york\n\nGeorge Carlin described his comedy as focusing on 3 things: love of language and how we use it; the small things, moments we all share as humans; and the big topics of our culture—war, death, children, religion, etc. A social commentator, he challenged conventional wisdom and brought us face-to-face with our ingrained hypocrisies. There was no topic off limits to his keen observation, wordplay, goofy jabs and rants, whether it was drugs, war, politics, the accumulation of stuff or the way in which we use words.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/georgecarlin\">#georgecarlin</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/standupcomedy\">#standupcomedy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/travel\">#travel</a>","viewCount":1691411,"lengthSeconds":1014,"watchProgress":80.060602,"timeWatched":1735053404669,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"TfOWoeDWdLJwona6","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":4999,"lengthSeconds":85,"watchProgress":81.294934,"timeWatched":1737102832194,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"U5QqApd2GF4vQG9E","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Picking up where he left off with the Grammy-nominated Thanks For Risking Your Life. This time Lewis has the view of someone who spent entirely too much time in isolation during the Pandemic, where the irksome details of life drew his acute attention. As the world shut down in the spring of 2020, Lewis went on a quarantine-tinged journey of self-discovery which led him to many personal revelations, including that he is old, that solitary confinement is a punishment, and that all recipes are made for a happy family of four, and most importantly, never look directly in a cat’s eyes.\n\nDespite the trials of quarantine, Lewis’ feisty streak has not faded. In the “new” normal, he is quick to acknowledge that he’s feeling a significant level of frustration at the thought of creating comedy in a world where the reality of events exists only in the minds of the viewers. His job now is to nightly counteract the daily narratives presented by the former president, the current Ghost of Christmas Past, and the conspiracy theorists and Walmart shoppers who span the political and social spectrum.\n\nRecorded Live at The Paramount Theater, Huntington, New York in May 2022.\n\n__\n\nChapters: \n0:00 - Intro \n1:39 - Great Expectations \n3:13 - You Didn&apos;t Do Your Homework \n7:50 - One Hundred and Three \n10:48 - Shutdown \n14:34 - Provisions \n17:45 - Should Have Been A Peacock \n23:58 - Somebody F’ed A WHATTTTT!!??!! \n26:54 - Solitary Confinement \n36:57 - &quot;Cats&quot; \n40:40 - A Mask Is A Mask \n44:22 - To Vax Or Not To Vax \n51:15 - Cray-Cray \n55:13 - Companionship \n\n__\n\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by: Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by: Jack Gulick and Benjamin Brewer\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nLighting Director: John Finen\nEdited By: Derek Ambrosi\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nAudio Recording Engineer: Philip Shipman - The Sound Co-Op\nSound Edit &amp; Re-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nColorist: Dave Colonna\nScreen Art: Sam Black\n\n__\n\n“Tragically, I Need You” is available for purchase Digitally (May 2nd) and on CD (June 9th)\nDigital release: https://lnk.fu.ga/lewisblack_tragicallyineedyou\nCD Release: https://tinyurl.com/LewisBlackCD\n\n—\n\nFOLLOW LEWIS\nOfficial Website: http://www.lewisblack.com/\nTour &amp; Tickets: http://www.lewisblack.com/tickets\n\nLewis Black’s Rantcast (podcast): https://thelaughbutton.podlink.to/Rantcast \nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thelewisblack\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/thelewisblack\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thelewisblack\nTikTok: http://www.tiktok.com/@thelewisblack \nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/officiallewisblack\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/standupcomedy\">#standupcomedy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/comedy\">#comedy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/lewisblack\">#lewisblack</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/tragicallyineedyou\">#tragicallyIneedyou</a>\n\n©2023 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc.

In this video, we will compare the two operating systems and help you decide which one is better for you.\n\n🖥️ Linux Mint 21.2 is based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and features the Cinnamon desktop environment. It comes with a host of new features and improvements, including a new kernel, updated software packages, and enhanced system stability.\n\n🐞 LMDE 6, on the other hand, is based on Debian 12 and aims to be as similar as possible to Linux Mint, but without using Ubuntu. It features the Cinnamon desktop environment and provides users with a stable and reliable operating system.\n\n🔍 In this video, we will compare the two operating systems in terms of performance, stability, user interface, and software availability. We will also provide you with our recommendations on which one to choose based on your needs and preferences.\n\n🎥 So, if you’re looking to switch to a new Linux distribution or just curious about the differences between Linux Mint 21.2 and LMDE 6, this video is for you!\n\nChapters:\n00:00 Intro\n00:18 Boot &amp; Install\n02:00 First Login\n02:35 Updates\n05:22 Release Cycles\n05:47 Driver Manager\n06:23 Themes\n06:44 Neofetch\n07:18 Nemo File Manager\n07:35 System Settings\n07:58 Extensions\n08:16 Package Manager\n08:45 Wallpapers\n09:04 Not a rolling release\n09:39 Mainline\n11:35 The future\n12:14 Outro\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/lmde\">#lmde</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxmint\">#linuxmint</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linux\">#linux</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/thelinuxitguy\">#TheLinuxITGuy</a>","viewCount":19004,"lengthSeconds":748,"watchProgress":41.22666,"timeWatched":1710796361823,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"VGWYzPUQi8MZqIdK"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":171381,"lengthSeconds":152,"watchProgress":151.527151,"timeWatched":1737274824019,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"WxY7p1FodQ60e1FH","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

This issue was reported on my GitLab ( https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/issues/112 ).  I have since implemented some changes as suggested in the GitLab thread.   There are still some minor bugs.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others.

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the essential commands for copying files and directories in the Linux terminal. Whether you&apos;re managing a personal project or working on a professional server, these commands will help you efficiently handle file operations. Let&apos;s dive in!\n\nCopying Files\n\nTo copy files in Linux, you use the `cp` (copy) command. The basic syntax is:\n```bash\ncp [options] source destination\n```\n\n#### Example 1: Copy a Single File\n\nTo copy a file named `example.txt` from your current directory to a directory called `backup`, use:\n```bash\ncp example.txt backup/\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Copy Multiple Files\n\nTo copy multiple files (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`) into a directory named `backup`, use:\n```bash\ncp file1.txt file2.txt backup/\n```\n\n#### Example 3: Preserve File Attributes\n\nTo preserve the file attributes (like permissions, timestamps) while copying, use the `-p` option:\n```bash\ncp -p example.txt backup/\n```\n\nCopying Directories\n\nTo copy directories and their contents, you need to use the `-r` (recursive) option with the `cp` command.\n\n#### Example 1: Copy a Directory\n\nTo copy a directory named `projects` to a directory named `backup`, use:\n```bash\ncp -r projects/ backup/\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Copy a Directory with Verbose Output\n\nTo get detailed output while copying, use the `-v` (verbose) option:\n```bash\ncp -rv projects/ backup/\n```\n\nAdvanced Options\n\n#### Example 1: Overwrite Without Prompting\n\nTo copy files and overwrite the destination files without prompting, use the `-f` (force) option:\n```bash\ncp -f example.txt backup/\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Interactive Copy\n\nTo prompt before overwriting files, use the `-i` (interactive) option:\n```bash\ncp -i example.txt backup/\n```\n\n#### Example 3: Copying Only When Source is Newer\n\nTo copy files only if the source file is newer than the destination file, use the `-u` (update) option:\n```bash\ncp -u example.txt backup/\n```\n\nCopying with Wildcards\n\nYou can use wildcards to copy multiple files that match a certain pattern.\n\n#### Example 1: Copy All Text Files\n\nTo copy all `.txt` files from the current directory to a directory named `backup`, use:\n```bash\ncp *.txt backup/\n```\n\nConclusion\n\nThat&apos;s it! You&apos;ve learned how to copy files and directories in the Linux terminal using the `cp` command with various options to suit your needs. Mastering these commands will greatly enhance your efficiency in managing files on a Linux system.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":50852,"lengthSeconds":93,"watchProgress":90.076228,"timeWatched":1737275621973,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"Zk2tuuGx2bjNUGsT","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

The live performance includes classic routines, &quot;More Stuff on Cars and Driving,&quot; &quot;Reagan‘s Gang, Church People, and American Values,&quot; &quot;People I Can Do Without,&quot; and &quot;Keeping People Alert.&quot;\n\nStream the full special here: https://tubitv.com/movies/504455/george-carlin-what-am-i-doing-in-new-jersey\n\nGeorge Carlin described his comedy as focusing on 3 things: love of language and how we use it; the small things, moments we all share as humans; and the big topics of our culture—war, death, children, religion, etc. A social commentator, he challenged conventional wisdom and brought us face-to-face with our ingrained hypocrisies. There was no topic off limits to his keen observation, wordplay, goofy jabs and rants, whether it was drugs, war, politics, the accumulation of stuff or the way in which we use words.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/georgecarlin\">#georgecarlin</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/standupcomedy\">#standupcomedy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/politics\">#politics</a>","viewCount":459042,"lengthSeconds":405,"watchProgress":404.747,"timeWatched":1735055284170,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"ZtY7LFZoZ1xbPhSe","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Grep searches one or more input files for lines containing a match to a specified pattern. By default, Grep outputs the matching lines but it has a ton of flags and options available. \n\nERRATA:\nI mentioned that Grep doesn&apos;t like binaries.  That&apos;s not entirely true.  There is a way to grep a binary as if it were a text file by using the &quot;-a&quot; flag.

You don’t typically get an application launcher, or a terminal, or literally any nice-to-have tool really. think of things you would NEED like a lockscreen, system idling, all of that stuff.","viewCount":38973,"lengthSeconds":781,"watchProgress":20.473126,"timeWatched":1729937944447,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"e38RSVPCF0buT7ee","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Follow this step-by-step guide to learn how:\n\n1. Log in to GitHub:\n   - Go to the GitHub website (github.com) and log in to your GitHub account.\n\n2. Access Personal Access Tokens Settings:\n   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner of the screen.\n   - Select &quot;Settings&quot; from the dropdown menu.\n   - In the left sidebar, click on &quot;Developer settings&quot; and then choose &quot;Personal access tokens&quot;.\n\n3. Generate a New Token:\n   - Click on the &quot;Generate new token&quot; button.\n   - Provide a descriptive note for the token to remember its purpose.\n   - Select the desired scopes or permissions for the token.\n     - For pushing changes, you may need to select the &quot;repo&quot; or &quot;public_repo&quot; scope.\n   - Once you&apos;ve selected the appropriate settings, click on the &quot;Generate token&quot; button.\n\n4. Copy the Token:\n   - After generating the token, GitHub will display it on the screen.\n   - **Important**: This token is only shown once, so make sure to copy it to a safe location.\n\n5. Use the Token for Pushing Changes:\n   - Open your Git client or command line interface.\n   - Navigate to the local repository where you want to push changes.\n   - Instead of using your GitHub password, use the generated personal access token as the password when prompted.\n     - For example, when pushing changes via HTTPS, the command will prompt for username and password. Enter your GitHub username and the personal access token as the password.\n     - If you&apos;re using SSH, make sure to update your Git remote URL to use the SSH URL instead of HTTPS.\n\nBy following these steps, you can generate a personal access token in GitHub and use it to push changes using Git. Remember to keep your personal access token secure and avoid sharing it with others to maintain the security of your GitHub account.","viewCount":47430,"lengthSeconds":312,"watchProgress":0,"timeWatched":1720769053356,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"eAC2inZzUgTcFben","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

In this video, we&apos;ll show you how to concatenate files in Linux using simple command-line tools. Concatenating files is a common task, whether you&apos;re merging text files, combining logs, or processing data. This tutorial will guide you through the different methods to concatenate files in Linux, making it easy to join multiple files into one.\n\n<b>*Why Concatenate Files in Linux?*</b>\n\nConcatenating files is useful in many scenarios, such as combining several log files into one for easier analysis, merging multiple text files into a single document, or appending data to an existing file. The Linux command line offers powerful and flexible tools that make this task straightforward, even when dealing with large files or complex directory structures.\n\n<b>*What You’ll Learn:*</b>\n\n- <b>*The `cat` Command:*</b> We’ll start by introducing the `cat` command, the most straightforward way to concatenate files in Linux. You’ll learn how to use `cat` to combine multiple files into one, either by outputting the result to the terminal or redirecting it to a new file.\n\n- <b>*Appending Files with `--`:*</b> Next, we’ll demonstrate how to append the contents of one file to another using the `--` operator. This is particularly useful when you need to add data to an existing file without overwriting it.\n\n- <b>*Using `paste` for Side-by-Side Concatenation:*</b> We’ll also explore the `paste` command, which allows you to merge files side by side, line by line. This method is helpful when you want to combine data from multiple files into a tabular format.\n\n- <b>*Merging Files with `awk`:*</b> For more advanced users, we’ll show you how to use `awk` to concatenate files while performing text processing or formatting. `awk` is a powerful text-processing tool that offers greater flexibility and control over the output.\n\n- <b>*Combining Files with `find` and `cat`:*</b> Finally, we’ll cover how to use the `find` command in combination with `cat` to concatenate files across multiple directories. This method is particularly useful when you need to merge files that are spread out over different locations on your system.\n\n<b>*Key Features:*</b>\n\n- <b>*Beginner-Friendly Instructions:*</b> We provide clear, step-by-step instructions, making this tutorial accessible even if you’re new to Linux or the command line.\n  \n- <b>*Multiple Methods:*</b> We cover various tools and techniques, from simple commands to more advanced options, allowing you to choose the method that best suits your needs.\n  \n- <b>*Practical Examples:*</b> Real-world examples help you understand when and why to use each method, ensuring you can apply these techniques in your own projects.\n\nMake sure to watch the full video to learn how to efficiently concatenate files in Linux, and don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more Linux tips, tutorials, and tech content!\n\n<b>*Helpful Resources:*</b>\n\n- GNU Core Utilities Manual: [GNU cat](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/cat-invocation.html)\n- `awk` Command Documentation: [AWK User Guide](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html)\n- Linux `find` Command Guide: [Find Command Examples](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-find-command-in-linux/)\n\nIf you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to leave a comment below, and we&apos;ll do our best to assist you!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxcommands\">#LinuxCommands</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/fileconcatenation\">#FileConcatenation</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxtutorial\">#LinuxTutorial</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/commandline\">#CommandLine</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxforbeginners\">#LinuxForBeginners</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/catcommand\">#CatCommand</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/awkcommand\">#AwkCommand</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxtips\">#LinuxTips</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/opensource\">#OpenSource</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/techtutorial\">#TechTutorial</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxfiles\">#LinuxFiles</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/dataprocessing\">#DataProcessing</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxbasics\">#LinuxBasics</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/systemadministration\">#SystemAdministration</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linuxcommunity\">#LinuxCommunity</a>","viewCount":212,"lengthSeconds":587,"watchProgress":9.607022,"timeWatched":1724243447181,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"ffwa6plEiHtBAWhP","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":7978,"lengthSeconds":108,"watchProgress":105.373786,"timeWatched":1737102719165,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"hTSv5hNSVlZjKIjc","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

KDE Plasma 5 is the successor of KDE Plasma 4 and was initially released on 15 July 2014. It includes a new default theme, known as &quot;Breeze&quot;, as well as increased convergence across different devices. The graphical interface was fully migrated to QML, which uses OpenGL for hardware acceleration resulting in better performance and reduced power consumption.\n\nKDE Plasma 5 is built using Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5,[7] predominantly plasma-framework.[8]\n\nPlasma 5.0 improves support for HiDPI displays and ships a converged graphical shell, able to modify the graphical shell according to the device in use. It also includes a new default theme, dubbed Breeze. Changes under the hood include the migration to a new, fully hardware-accelerated graphics stack centered on an OpenGL(ES)-based scene graph (canvas). Plasma 5 completes the migration of KDE Plasma 4 to QtQuick. Qt 5&apos;s QtQuick 2 uses a hardware-accelerated OpenGL(ES) scenegraph to compose and render graphics on the screen, which allows for the offloading of computationally expensive graphics rendering tasks onto the GPU, which frees up resources on the system&apos;s main CPU, and is faster and more power efficient.","viewCount":5582,"lengthSeconds":175,"watchProgress":92.603394,"timeWatched":1712615129255,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"iSfr7L4XQtPp0VIx"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":43106,"lengthSeconds":125,"watchProgress":120.322371,"timeWatched":1737100516312,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"isYaXQgp0AHEalqV","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

{"videoId":"C9hMaqQFKXk","title":"Inner Balance | 432Hz + 111Hz Healing Calm & Inner Peace | Release All Blockages Meditation & Sleep","author":"Inner Lotus Music","authorId":"UC-hVOGj2apTeEvc49CrjQlg","published":1693166406000,"description":"The natural frequency of 432Hz, also called the“Earth frequency”, is the frequency everything in our Universe resonates with. This specially composed music for meditation and/or sleep in the healing frequency of 432 Hz is here for you to lovingly help you to let go of all blockages, reset your mind, body and soul and find back to inner balance and deep inner peace.\n\nYou can buy &amp; download the original full length track here:\nhttps://innerlotusmusic.com/a/s/wtqgqv\n\nVisit the Inner Lotus Music Store:\nhttps://innerlotusmusic.com/\n\n\nStream the single edit on: \n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/1sbiGdXC71zHd7D7A2293f\nAmazon Music: https://amazon.com/music/player/tracks/B0D2J86K8J\nOther streaming platforms: https://linktr.ee/innerlotusmusic\n\n\nIf you enjoy my music and would like to support me, you are welcome to subscribe to my channel 🤗 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-hVOGj2apTeEvc49CrjQlg \nHit the ((🔔)) to turn on notifications and receive the latest Inner Lotus Music!   \n\n\nThe natural frequency of 432Hz, also called the“Earth frequency”, is the frequency everything in our Universe resonates with. Music tuned to 432 Hz is proven to be relaxing for body and mind and very often also perceived as being more harmonic and pleasant than the “standard” 440 Hz, which is the frequency that most of the modern day music we listen to is tuned at. \n\nMusic tuned to 432 Hz is often perceived as being softer and more pleasant. It is said to provide greater clarity and is easier on the ears. In short, 432 Hz music can fill the mind with a sense of deep peace and well-being, while releasing emotional blockages that hinder us from letting go and experiencing full inner and outer harmony.  \n\nThe frequency of 111Hz, also known as “divine frequency” is said to be a “holy” frequency, allowing deepest states of meditation and connecting to higher spheres of consciousness. According to scientific reports, MRI scans have shown that - when listening to 111 Hz - our brain reduces prefrontal cortex activity and slows down the so-called “language center”, inducing a phase at exactly 111 Hz. This reaction results in a divine level of meditation. A state of trance that is said to allow connection with the universe, or a spiritual guide.\n\n\nIf you enjoy this video, you might also resonate with the following 432Hz music:\n\n432Hz + 111Hz Energetic Cleanse &amp; Spiritual Healing Frequency | Flute, Bowls &amp; Rain Meditation Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eaq9vskuvWI&t=0s\n\nKundalini Awakening | 111Hz + 432Hz Rising of the Goddess Within | Yoga, Energy &amp; Meditation Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHJHje069UQ&t=0s\n\nHealing Calm &amp; Deep Inner Peace | Release All Blockages | 432 Hz Spiritual Meditation &amp; Sleep Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKdeOdxl0UQ&t=0s\n\nAnd if you would like to discover more music written in the natural Earth frequency of 432Hz, you can find it in this playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXwfGygOmeUXtiuasFbNoSNUJOt9ibMvy\n\n\nFor this meditation and/or sleep music, all instruments have been specifically and carefully tuned to 432 Hz and 111Hz. Therefore, the music in this video is an original 432Hz + 111Hz composition and has not been artificially tuned to these frequencies after completion. I am convinced that composing music in the original frequency will lead to better results when it comes to deploying the positive energy and benefits of these particular natural frequencies. \n\nFeel free to listen to this meditation and/or sleep music with headphones at a moderate level or - if you prefer - just let it flow through open space. As long as it is positive for your body and soul, it will be positive for you. \n\nLove and gratitude 🧡🙏🏼 \nPierre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Do not listen to music emphasizing particular frequencies if you suffer from epilepsy! If you have any concerns or other health issues you are uncertain of, please check with your medical practitioner prior to listening. Please do not listen to the music on this channel whilst driving or operating machinery of any kind! Although this music can help you to relax, meditate and sleep, it is not taking the place of professional medical and/or therapeutic advice and/or treatment. \n\nMusic composed and produced by Pierre Ynad \nTitle: Inner Balance\nCopyright ⓒ 2023 Inner Lotus Music™.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":11255,"lengthSeconds":107,"watchProgress":105.694834,"timeWatched":1737100648429,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"kWqxnFmnzoMl8Tym","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":258548,"lengthSeconds":111,"watchProgress":107.174901,"timeWatched":1737104332849,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"mXPWNrbq9rniM128","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":362529,"lengthSeconds":133,"watchProgress":129.250473,"timeWatched":1737100853022,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"mtB1wmrPlafCXVD9","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

These will now show a header, to let you know which app spawned that notification, and they&apos;ll include a little symbolic icon as well.\nOn top of that, notifications that are pretty long, or have action buttons can also be expanded, or collapsed.\n\nExperimental support for variable refresh rate is here, it&apos;s turned off by default, and you&apos;ll have to use dconf to turn it on. Once you do that, you&apos;ll get a switch for that feature in the Display settings, provided your display supports it, with a &quot;preferred refresh rate&quot; list.\n\n(gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features &quot;[&apos;variable-refresh-rate&apos;]&quot;)\n\nAnother change is in how fonts are rendered using fractional scaling: they&apos;re now less blurry, and will look more consistent.\n\nOther, smaller changes include the ability to press control + super and a number to launch the associated app from your dock. You also get remote login using RDP.\n\nThe file manager, Nautilus, got way better in this release. First, you can now click the path bar to edit the location manually, instead of having to press control + L to do so.\n\nNext is search: it now performs much faster than it used to, and the search button now does a global search directly. When transferring files, the progress bar has been moved to the bottom of the sidebar. Changing a folder icon is now much easier as well, you can just open its properties, and you have a little edit icon.\n\nIn the settings, there&apos;s a new &quot;system&quot; page. The mouse and touchpad settings now let you configure how you trigger the right click. You can also turn off the touchpad when typing, or disable that setting if you don&apos;t like it.\n\nThe GNOME Online accounts also received some love, notably for its backend: it now uses the default browser for authentication into accounts. You can also add a WebDAV account to get access to contacts, calendars and files, and you can add a Microsoft Personal Account as well.\n\nGNOME Software, the app store, now shows the Verified badges on Flathub applications that have them.\nGNOME Calendar gained performance improvements, which it sort of needed, and it now displays the current month a lot more visibly in the month view, so you always know where you are.\n\nThe image viewer, Loupe, now has a keyboard shortcut to permanently delete an image, it&apos;s shift + delete.\n\nEpiphany, the web browser, now automatically retrieves app names and icons from websites using their progressive web apps manifests if they have one, so everything will already be nice and tidy when you create a web app from the browser. It also fixes some issues with how it syncs with your Firefox account, and it gained support for smart card authentication as well, meaning you can authenticate using USB devices while using Epiphany.\n\nGNOME Maps moved their controls to the bottom of the application, and gained improvements to the vector map layer, although this one is still experimental. It also improved how favourite places work, with a default empty state explaining what favourites are.\n\nFinally, GNOME Music has been ported to use the latest libadwaita widgets, and it removed support for Last.FM scrobbling, and the song list view. it also gained a preferences dialogue, which doesn&apos;t contain much, but still lets you set the repeat mode, enable replayGain, or inhibit suspend when playing music.","viewCount":64311,"lengthSeconds":959,"watchProgress":126.266315,"timeWatched":1711053091701,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"pRUrAOg9Uu4iNpDz"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":251179,"lengthSeconds":191,"watchProgress":188.84809,"timeWatched":1737104731108,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"q88dxgFi6TfehSHj","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

{"videoId":"QL-GE5v5gRk","title":"How to convert JPG to PDF file (2024)","author":"ProgrammingKnowledge2","authorId":"UC8aFE06Cti9OnQcKpl6rDvQ","published":1714554021000,"description":"How to Convert JPG to PDF File\n\nIn this tutorial, we&apos;ll guide you through the process of converting JPG images to a PDF file, enabling you to combine multiple images into a single PDF document with ease.\n\nConverting JPG images to a PDF file is a useful task, whether you need to create a PDF document from scanned photos, compile a portfolio of images, or merge multiple pictures into one file. With the right tools and techniques, you can convert JPG files to PDF format quickly and efficiently, preserving the quality and layout of your images.\n\nFollow these step-by-step instructions to convert JPG images to a PDF file:\n\n1. **Use Online JPG to PDF Converters**: Many online services and tools offer features for converting JPG images to PDF format directly from your web browser. Examples include Smallpdf, PDF2Go, and Online2PDF. Visit the website of your chosen tool, upload the JPG images you want to convert, and click the convert button. Once the conversion is complete, download the PDF file containing your images to your computer.\n\n2. **Use PDF Printer Software**: If you have a PDF printer software installed on your computer, such as Adobe Acrobat, CutePDF, or PDFCreator, you can use it to convert JPG images to PDF format. Open the JPG images in your preferred image viewer or editor, then select the print option. Choose the PDF printer as the destination printer, then configure the settings as needed (such as page orientation, size, and quality). Click print to generate the PDF file containing your images, then save it to your computer.\n\n3. **Use Image Editing Software**: Many image editing software applications, such as Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, and Paint.NET, offer features for exporting images to PDF format. Open the JPG images in your preferred image editing software, then navigate to the option for exporting or saving the images. Choose PDF as the output format, then configure the settings as needed (such as compression, color space, and resolution). Click export or save to generate the PDF file containing your images, then save it to your computer.\n\n4. **Use Command Line Tools**: For more advanced users comfortable with the command line, tools like ImageMagick provide command line interfaces for converting images to PDF format. Install ImageMagick on your computer, open a command prompt or terminal window, and use the appropriate commands to convert your JPG images to a PDF file.\n\nBy following these methods, you can easily convert JPG images to a PDF file, allowing you to create versatile and shareable documents from your pictures.\n\nDon&apos;t forget to like, share, and subscribe for more tutorials on document management, PDF tips, and productivity hacks.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/jpgtopdf\">#JPGtoPDF</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/imageconversion\">#ImageConversion</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/pdfconversion\">#PDFConversion</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/documentmanagement\">#DocumentManagement</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/pdftools\">#PDFTools</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/productivitytips\">#ProductivityTips</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/techtutorials\">#TechTutorials</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/tutorial\">#Tutorial</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/howto\">#HowTo</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/imageediting\">#ImageEditing</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/onlinetools\">#OnlineTools</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/desktopsoftware\">#DesktopSoftware</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/pdfprinter\">#PDFPrinter</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/pdfcreation\">#PDFCreation</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/imagemanipulation\">#ImageManipulation</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/documentcreation\">#DocumentCreation</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/documentconversion\">#DocumentConversion</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/contentcreation\">#ContentCreation</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/documentmanagement\">#DocumentManagement</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/imageconversiontools\">#ImageConversionTools</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/contentintegration\">#ContentIntegration</a>","viewCount":84,"lengthSeconds":84,"watchProgress":83.893695,"timeWatched":1714587739367,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"rKiLSS5CS4RIyboz"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":1572,"lengthSeconds":97,"watchProgress":94.364288,"timeWatched":1737746650826,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"rVC1STHCrfHc3prM","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Some distros tend to modify these kernels with additional patches, or features that haven&apos;t been added yet, which is why you can see some kernel versions with a &quot;-ubuntu&quot; at the end for example.\n\nCertain kernel versions are also marked as LTS, meaning Long Term support. These are versions that will be supported for much longer, up to 6 years. The Linux kernel project recently reduced that support window to 2 years.\n\nSince both the stable and LTS kernels ship with some non free firmware, there&apos;s the Kernel Libre project, which removes all of that, to only ship software and code that is completely free, as in freedom..\n\nNext, we have the hardened kernel. It&apos;s not an &quot;official&quot; project per se, it&apos;s a kernel version that certain distros ship in their repos, like Arch Linux for example. It&apos;s the stable kernel, with an additional patch set applied to it to make it more resilient security-wise.\n\nNext, we have the realtime kernel. The goal is to reduce the latency between a task being assigned to the CPU, and its execution, and it&apos;s mainly meant for industrial applications, or for audio production.\nThis, in turn, makes it less efficient for multi tasking, and it requires a lot more manual config to be efficient, and applications need to be specifically tailored to take advantage of this lower latency.\n\nThe low latency kernel variants do the same thing, but at a lesser degree: it still lets you pre-empt CPU threads like the real time kernel, but it isn&apos;t as regular as the realtime kernel.\n\nThe Android kernel is focused on supporting a specific category of devices, meaning that it has optimizations for these exact things.\n\nThe Zen kernel applies a few fixes and improvements meant to have the best performance and experience for linux desktop users. It&apos;s also packaged as the Liquorix kernel for Ubuntu or Debian, and other distros, although Liquorix isn&apos;t exactly like the Zen kernel.\n\nAnother version is the XanMod kernel, with sort of the same optimization as the Zen kernel, and a few more on top of that, with the same goal: improving the performance of Linux systems.\n\nFinally, we have the TKG kernels, and I&apos;m saying kernels, because TKG isn&apos;t a specific Linux kernel you can download and use, it&apos;s more like a build system that lets you choose a few specific patches and compile your own kernel with that.","viewCount":5993,"lengthSeconds":1051,"watchProgress":920.968924,"timeWatched":1715275306089,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"rhQseIwAhS7WbIf2"}

It single-handedly turned the Linux desktop from something that was only usable by really knowledgeable people, into something that was really accessible to the masses, even then.\n\nThen in short succession, they dropped Unity, version 7 for the desktop, and version 8 which was meant to be the successor, that brought convergence between device type, they dropped Mir, their display server that was meant to replace  X.org and be an alternative to Wayland, and they basically settled for GNOME 3.\n\nUbuntu has a desktop problem. Since it basically abandoned the leadership of the desktop to the community, it also doesn&apos;t seem to anticipate things very much. Which means that the extensions they apply to GNOME pull them backwards.\n\nWaiting 6 months to get what everyone else has sucks, and you get a Frankenbuntu mishmash of versions of apps and libraries, that can&apos;t really be as stable as having the whole lot on the same version number.\n\nUbuntu also has fixed repo versions for apps, desktop environments, and libraries. Only security fixes come through, apart from a few apps, like web browsers. This means that this frankenbuntu is locked in place. If you use 22.04 LTS, you&apos;re never getting the full GNOME 42 in your repos.\n\nUbuntu also has an apps problem. Ubuntu pushes Snaps, their own containerized solution.\n\nOn the desktop, Snaps have issues. These issues were shared in the past by other similar formats, like Flatpak, or Appimages. But nowadays, it&apos;s really, really late to the party. It doesn&apos;t support dark mode integration. It doesn&apos;t integrate with themes. it doesn&apos;t offer a way to solve these issues, contrary to Flatpak and the Flatseal app for example.\n\nBecause it uses fixed repos, without feature updates, it needs a way to bring application updates to the desktop, and this way, is supposedly Snaps. The issue is, the snap store doesn&apos;t seem to have as many desktop apps as Flathub has, and snap as a solution is getting increasingly outdated, slow to launch, and less well integrated than Flatpak. It&apos;s also being aggressively pushed to Ubuntu users, and this impacts downstream distros, for example, Canonical decided to only ship Chromium as a Snap, which meant that other distros, like Linux Mint, had to take on the burden of packaging and maintaining it themselves if they didn&apos;t want to adopt the snap version.\n\nUbuntu is still very easy to use. But its crown in terms of &quot;the easiest distro for beginners&quot; is long gone. Nowadays, plenty of options are better than Ubuntu for complete Linux beginners.\n\nLinux Mint has a relentless drive to keep working on what made Ubuntu great in the first place: everything must have a GUI to configure it. Zorin OS does as well, <b>*even though its GNOME implementation is also a frankenbuntu, or frankenzorin or whatever.*</b>\n\nThese 2 options alone are, in my opinion, much better for beginners than Ubuntu. They have more quality of life features, like built in accent colors, more configuration tools, and they support more software, plus all the software made for Ubuntu.","viewCount":971813,"lengthSeconds":816,"watchProgress":724.678361,"timeWatched":1714993299882,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"rvSGkAAa3WqbnvVa"}

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":9341,"lengthSeconds":94,"watchProgress":94.203356,"timeWatched":1737117651268,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"u0uuSAzqyTTwWuSD","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

It&apos;s always good to take a look at all the installed applications, and libraries, and remove what you don&apos;t use anymore. You can also remove packages that aren&apos;t linked to anything else and aren&apos;t used by anything.\n\nOn Debian or Ubuntu, for example, you can find these by running sudo apt autoremove\n\nAnd on a desktop, you probably already apply updates, or your distro has auto updates enabled. But on a server, it&apos;s easy to let things slide, and forget to log in regularly and make sure things are up to date. I&apos;m guilty of that myself.\n\nAnd just like with packages, libraries, and apps, you should also make sure you only run the services you actually use. You can list all services running with:\n\nsystemctl list-unit-files\n\nTo stop a service you don&apos;t need, you can run \n\nsystemctl stop SERVICE\n\nTo stop the service from starting with the system, you can run\n\nsystemctl disable SERVICE\n\nIf you&apos;re on a server, the general rule of thumb is also NOT to run a graphical desktop on it. It will often be much more secure to use SSH to log in to the server remotely.\n\nBut you might also need to secure SSH first. If you have multiple users, make sure only the ones who need it have SSH access. To do that, you can edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, and type AllowUsers then the names of the users that will actually have access to SSH.\n\nNow, something that might be useful in general, for a server or a desktop, is making sure all the users are correctly handled. The first thing will be to disable root login.\n\nIf you decide to disable the root account, make sure at least one user has admin privileges though, or you&apos;ll have a system without any way to access any task with sudo. Once you&apos;re certain everything is ok, you can use the following method:\n\nEdit /etc/passwd, and change the first line, by replacing /bin/bash, or whatever other shell root currently logs into, by /sbin/nologin (or /usr/sbin/nologin depending on the distro)\n\nIf you prefer, you can simply disable root login through SSH, so the account is still there if you want it locally, but remote attackers won&apos;t be able to login as root. To do so, you can edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and uncomment the PermitRootLogin line, and then set its value to no. Restart SSH with sytemctl restart sshd, and you&apos;re done.\n\nTo remove the ability to use USB, Thunderbolt or Firewire, you can add the following lines to their respective files (create them if need be). To revert this, just remove the lines that have been added in the various files by the commands.\n\nAdd: install usb-storage /bin/true to  /etc/modprobe.d/disable-usb-storage.conf\nAdd blacklist firewire-core  to /etc/modprobe.d/firewire.conf\nAdd blacklist thunderbolt  to /etc/modprobe.d/thunderbolt.conf","viewCount":170527,"lengthSeconds":1045,"watchProgress":924.569158,"timeWatched":1710004914985,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"uQPh7SFYjBpVBR9r"}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":43653,"lengthSeconds":117,"watchProgress":116.193558,"timeWatched":1737274702041,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"ugMfGe5gNSpWtire","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":121890,"lengthSeconds":183,"watchProgress":182.042629,"timeWatched":1737274514464,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"vI5oD3tJ56UH3NU4","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

It resonates at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against a surface or with an object. Metal tuning forks are never 100% accurate, and they lose accuracy over time. This makes these audio files more reliable for accuracy.\n\nDue to a popular request, I have decided to upload the original audio files to my website. This allows anybody to download the original audio file used in each video before it&apos;s compressed. These are large files, and it costs money to host them on a server, so they are being sold for less than the price of a cup of coffee.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":29030,"lengthSeconds":155,"watchProgress":151.592748,"timeWatched":1737275323320,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"w2M6Blq6kszjX2gN","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

I&apos;ll briefly cover how the whole thing works, in an under 10 minute video. As per the custom in these parts, there&apos;s a few vintage computing goodies peppered throughout the episode.\n\n🫶 Support (how this channel makes money) 🫶\n\nThis episode of Veronica Explains isn&apos;t sponsored by anyone other than you.

I find the history of Apple, and Apple-adjacent technology fascinating, and if that&apos;s something you&apos;re into as well, Macintosh Librarian is worth your attention.\n\nHer recent video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK-BkdnEF-8&t=0s\nHer channel (which you should subscribe to): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtZX_67hSjOIPu0HTmFi6aw\">@MacintoshLibrarian</a> \n\n🖥️ Commands used during the making of this video 🖥️\n`ssh-keygen` by itself: creates a default key in the default location (usually the .ssh folder inside the home directory).\n\nWith options, it gets more features. The `-t` option specifies the key type:\n-- `ssh-keygen -t rsa` generates an rsa key\n-- `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` generates an ed25519 key\n\nYou&apos;ll see me combine this with the `-f` option to specify the output file(s). So `ssh-keygen -f .ssh/testkeylmde -t ed25519` would create a key pair in the .ssh folder with the filename &quot;testkeylmde&quot; (and &quot;testkeylmde.pub&quot; for the public file).\n\nYou can then use `ssh-copy-id` to transfer and set up the public keyfile on a server, so that your private key will work with it:\n\n`ssh-copy-id -i [path-to-public-key] [user][at][server]`\n\nAs I mentioned a few times, I have a more thorough OpenSSH video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FKsdbjzBcc&t=0s\n\nAnd for further reading about cryptography in general, here&apos;s some Wikipedia I referenced in the video:\n\n- RSA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)\n- Curve25519 (where ed25519 gets its mathy bits from): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519\n- The Twisted Edwards curve: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Edwards_curve\n- EdDSA (the section on Ed25519): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519\n\n📖 Chapters 📖\n0:00 News about OpenSSH!\n1:48 The basics of OpenSSH and ssh-keygen\n4:27 How does this change impact you?\n7:34 Now&apos;s a good time to prune your keys\n9:04 What I&apos;m Watching: Macintosh Librarian\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/linux\">#linux</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/homelab\">#homelab</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/openssh\">#openssh</a>","viewCount":133255,"lengthSeconds":600,"watchProgress":141.116481,"timeWatched":1706376004017,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"wCQK2CtQYeEIzLle"}

Black doesn’t have set-ups to jokes so much as he has volcanic build-ups, twitchily rumbling up to eruptive punch lines. Black performed this set just days after the rest of the country shut down (the show was allowed to go on because it was in a sovereign Native American venue), so his commentary covers our current Corona-induced anxiety and his own hilarious frustration over The-Orange-One-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Lewis Black doesn’t take political sides; whether he’s exposing the wide-spread systemic failures of both parties, or pin-pointing the micro-stupidities within pop culture, commensurate rage is jettisoned in favor of deploying an overwhelming force of comic condemnation, punctuated by his ever-present arsenal of F-Bombs.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/lewisblack\">#lewisblack</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/thanksforriskingyourlife\">#thanksforriskingyourlife</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/standup\">#standup</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/comedy\">#comedy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/standupcomedy\">#standupcomedy</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/standupspecial\">#standupspecial</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/comedyspecial\">#comedyspecial</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/jokes\">#jokes</a>\n\nFollow Lewis Black at…\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thelewisblack/\nX/Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/TheLewisBlack\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thelewisblack\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/lewisblack\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3FbbI6zNALJhHAhwOJhEyg\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thelewisblack\n\nSubscribe to 800 Pound Gorilla’s YouTube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ9hfZ2sU7jFT9isA2rN58Q  \n\nFollow 800 Pound Gorilla:\nOfficial Website: https://800poundgorillamedia.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=product_shelf\nFacebook: https://800PGR.lnk.to/FacebookID\nTikTok: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TikTokID\nInstagram: https://800PGR.lnk.to/InstagramID\nX/Twitter: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TwitterID\n\n© 2020 Stark Raving Black Productions, Inc., All Rights Reserved\n\n– CREDITS –\nWritten &amp; Performed by Lewis Black\nDirected by Benjamin Brewer\nProduced by Jack Gulick, Benjamin Brewer\nAssociate Producer &amp; Post Supervisor: James Salkind\nExecutive Producer: Lewis Black\nEdited by Derek Ambrosi\nRe-Recording Mixer: Tom Efinger\nFinal Colorist: Keith Jensen\n\nLive Production –\nEIC: Ken Kuespert\nIMAG Director: Joe Hasse\nVideo Engineer: Dan Rousseve\nCameras: Gary Banks, Phil Patnaude, Donnie Rogers, James Salkind\nLighting Director: Cris Stefanick\nFOH Mixer: Ron Houvener\nStage Tech: Todd Hartman\nCamera Support &amp; Equipment: TPC Technologies Inc.\nStage &amp; Venue Crew: SLS Production Services\nSound Edited by Jeff Seelye\nAudio Mix Facility: Red Hook Post, Brooklyn\nCaptioning by VDMS\nPost Production Services: Technicolor Postworks NY\nAccount Executive: Pete Olshansky\nProject Manager: Tracey Soast\n\nFor Stark Raving Black Productions – \nManagement: Benjamin Brewer\nAgent: Jackie Knobbe, UTA\nBusiness Management: Matt Lichtenberg, Level Four Business Management, LLC\nAccounting: Rhodora Ibay, Mark Cattalini, Amanda Matloubain\nInsurance &amp; Risk Management: Katy Gilbreath\nLegal Council: Del, Shaw, Moonves, Tanaka, Finkelstein &amp; Lezcano, Jon Moonves, Loan T.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":576416,"lengthSeconds":758,"watchProgress":755.695664,"timeWatched":1737275914946,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"x9xXN786XtXxZ1r5","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

Don&apos;t forget to like the video, subscribe to the channel, and hit the &quot;Thanks&quot; button on this video, if you can, and join our channel community here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnowc_KHgjVNj3Y-E-oQ8aw/join\n\n\nVideo Description\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn today&apos;s video I want to show you how to install an Android application APK file via the command line using ADB. \n\nADB is a great tool that allows you to customize Android in a number of ways. If there is a user-facing feature on Android then there is almost always a way to replicate that via the command line.\n\nI have found using this can be helpful when the OS is trying to limit you in other ways. For example, I had difficulties downloading an app on the Chinese version of MIUI in the past, but was able to bypass this limitation by using the ADB install command.\n\nTo begin, we first need to enable USB Debugging Mode. I&apos;ll link do a dedicated tutorial that I have already uploaded to the channel that shows you how to enable this on various Android devices, as a way of preventing this video from being longer than it needs to be. But if you&apos;re having trouble with this then let me know down in the comments section below.\n\nIf you&apos;re using a recent Xiaomi devcie with MIUI, then you will also need to enable something called Install via USB. This is found in the Developer Options menu as well and it does require you to sign into your Xiaomi Mi account while also having a SIM card installed.\n\nWe&apos;re also going to need to install ADB &amp; Fastboot tools onto a desktop or laptop PC. There are a number of ways this can be done, and I&apos;ll link to a video I&apos;ve already done that highlights a tool called Tiny ADB &amp; Fastboot tools. It&apos;s easy to install and will only put the files on your PC that are required to use both ADB and Fastboot commands.\n\nWith that done, you then need to download the APK file of the app or game you want to manually install, and it needs to be stored on your PC. Not only that, but you also need to put that APK file in the same folder as your ADB and Fastboot tools. You could avoid putting it into the same folder if you type out the full directory path of where that APK file is stored. But putting it in that same folder is the easiest option for most people.\n\nI will be using a free game called Galaxiga in today&apos;s example, just make sure you&apos;re downloading these APK files from a source you trust.\n\nLet&apos;s open up a command prompt, windows powershell, or a terminal window in the same folder as our ADB &amp; Fastboot tools.\n\nThen we&apos;ll begin by typing out the command. . .\n\nadb install [filename]\n\nWhen you finish typing it out, we simply need to press enter on the keyboard to execute the command and let ADB install this APK file for us. Look for the success message to know that it has been done correctly. . .\n\n. . .and then look in your App Drawer for the application icon for the newly installed application or game.\n\nThere are others arguments that we can add to this command if you want to do special things when installing this APK file.\n\nFor example, we can install multiple APK files at the same time by typing out. . .\n\nadb install-multiple [filename] [filename]\n\nor you could use this command to replace an existing application that is already installed on your device while keeping your app data intact.\n\nadb install -r [filename]\n\nIf you&apos;re wanting to downgrade an application you already have installed to an older version, then use the following command. . .\n\nadb install -d [filename]\n\nYou could even install an application to your sd card by using the command. . .\n\nadb install -s [filename]\n\n\nThere are many ways that we can manage the apps and games on our device using ADB. I have previously done a video showing you how to remove a system app from the default user account by using a simple ADB command. You can find that linked down below as well.\n\n\nMentioned Links\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDeveloper Mode - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwR2HIstT-c&t=0s\nUSB Debugging Mode - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdaNab8iVXA&t=0s\nTiny ADB &amp; Fastboot Tools - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic5HIG4r8cE&t=0s\n\n\n\nStep by Step Tutorial\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n1.

Java JDK is essential for developing Java applications and is widely used by developers around the world. Follow these instructions to get JDK 22 up and running on your Windows 11 system.\n\n<b>*Steps to Install Java JDK 22 on Windows 11:*</b>\n\n1. <b>*Download JDK 22:*</b>\n    - Visit the official [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).\n    - Locate Java SE Development Kit 22 and click on the download link for Windows.\n    - Accept the license agreement and download the JDK 22 installer (e.g., `jdk-22_windows-x64_bin.exe`).\n\n2. <b>*Run the Installer:*</b>\n    - Once the download is complete, navigate to the folder where the installer is saved.\n    - Double-click the installer file to run it.\n\n3. <b>*Install JDK 22:*</b>\n    - The installation wizard will open. Click &quot;Next&quot; to begin the installation process.\n    - Choose the installation directory. By default, it will be installed in `C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-22`. You can change this location if desired.\n    - Click &quot;Next&quot; to proceed.\n    - The installation process will begin. It may take a few minutes to complete.\n    - Once the installation is finished, click &quot;Close&quot; to exit the wizard.\n\n4. <b>*Set Up Environment Variables:*</b>\n    - Open the Start menu and search for &quot;Environment Variables&quot;. Select &quot;Edit the system environment variables&quot;.\n    - In the System Properties window, click on the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; button.\n    - Under the &quot;System variables&quot; section, click &quot;New&quot; to create a new environment variable.\n    - Set the variable name to `JAVA_HOME` and the variable value to the JDK installation path (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-22`).\n    - Click &quot;OK&quot; to save the new variable.\n\n5. <b>*Update the Path Variable:*</b>\n    - In the &quot;System variables&quot; section, scroll down and select the `Path` variable, then click &quot;Edit&quot;.\n    - Click &quot;New&quot; and add the path to the JDK `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-22\\bin`).\n    - Click &quot;OK&quot; to save the changes and close all windows.\n\n6. <b>*Verify the Installation:*</b>\n    - Open Command Prompt by searching for &quot;cmd&quot; in the Start menu.\n    - In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:\n      ```bash\n      java -version\n      ```\n    - You should see output indicating that Java 22 is installed, displaying the version number.\n    - Additionally, you can check the Java compiler by typing:\n      ```bash\n      javac -version\n      ```\n\n<b>*Conclusion:*</b>\n\nBy following these steps, you will have successfully installed Java JDK 22 on your Windows 11 system. This setup will enable you to develop and run Java applications.

This prestigious honor has not been extended to a comedian since 1973.\n\nAlongside Cho, comedian Gary Mule Deer was also invited to become a member. Both men were surprised by the invitation on January 6 when Opry member and Country Music Hall of Famer Marty Stuart announced it backstage at the Ryman Auditorium during a Facebook Live event.\n\n“After Marty surprised me with the invitation, someone asked if this was a dream come true. I had to say ‘no way!’” Cho beamed. “Because I’ve never even imagined this happening, not in any realm. I love performing on the Opry stage and it’s going to be really incredible to continue performing here, but now as a member of this historic organization.”\n\nCho’s TV credits include appearances on NBC’s The Tonight Show, CBS’s The Late, Late, Show, and NBC’s Young Comedians Special. He served two years as host of NBC’s Friday Night Videos and had many guest roles on various network sitcoms. Cho was co-creator, co-producer and co-writer of The Henry Cho Show on GAC.\n\nCho’s one hour Comedy Central Special, What’s That Clickin’ Noise? ran previously on Comedy Central and Netflix. He can also be heard daily on SiriusXM, Blue Collar Radio and Pandora. Some of Cho’s film credits include Universal’s McHale’s Navy with Tom Arnold and David Allen Greer; Say It Isn’t So with Heather Graham and Sally Field; and Material Girls with Hilary Duff and Angelica Houston produced by Madonna.\n\nCho was the keynote entertainer for The 59th Annual Radio &amp; Television Correspondents’ Dinner and has worked extensively with Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Willie Nelson, Carrie Underwood, Reba and many, others. Cho’s clean comedy is so versatile that he can headline Vegas and then tour with Michael W. Smith.\n\nCho has performed on the Opry over 100 times, making his Opry debut April 2, 2011.","viewCount":20365,"lengthSeconds":89,"watchProgress":84.520544,"timeWatched":1737100425812,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"yo5H9B9f7Z3kr3Mo","lastViewedPlaylistType":"","lastViewedPlaylistItemId":null}

This operating system is called Debian. Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel. Linux is a completely free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 50,000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) - all of it free. It&apos;s a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer.
