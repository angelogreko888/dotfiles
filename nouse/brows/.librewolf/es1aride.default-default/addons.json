You can choose from many available male and female voices. You can also set the pitch of the voice and the reading speed. Supports PDF. Supports EPUB (via the excellent EPUBReader extension).\n\nRead Aloud is a Firefox extension that uses text-to-speech technology to convert webpage text to audio. It works on a variety of websites, including news sites, blogs, fan fiction, publications, textbooks, school and class websites, online universities and course materials.\n\nRead Aloud is aimed at users who prefer to listen to content instead of reading, people with dyslexia or other learning disabilities, children learning to read, or simply to provide users with alternative way to consume web content.\n\nRead Aloud allows you to select from a variety of text-to-speech voices, including those provided natively by the browser, as well as by text-to-speech cloud service providers such as Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson, and Microsoft. Some of the cloud-based voices may require additional in-app purchase to enable.\n\nRecent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence has enabled very high-quality speech synthesis. Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly voices, for example, use bleeding edge technology to provide life-like synthetic speech that is close to that of human speech. Read Aloud allows you to use your own Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services account to enable these voices.\n\nTo use Read Aloud, simply navigate to the web page you want to read, then click the Read Aloud icon on the Firefox menu. In addition, the shortcut keys ALT-P, ALT-O, ALT-Comma, and ALT-Period can be used to Play/Pause, Stop, Rewind, and Forward, respectively. You may select the text you want to read before activating the extension. Right clicking on the selected text will provide you with yet another context-menu option to activate Read Aloud.\n\nTo change the voice, reading speed, pitch, or enable text highlighting, go to the Options page either by right clicking on the Read Aloud icon and choose Options, or by clicking the Gear button on the extension popup (you'll need to stop playback to see the Gear button).\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nPersonal information\nIf you use one of the Premium Voices, you'll be asked to sign in to your Google account and grant Read Aloud access to your basic user profile, which includes name and email address. We require this information for usage tracking, since the Premium Voices requires making a purchase when usage exceeds the monthly free tier. If you don't use the Premium Voices, you don't need to sign in, and no information is collected.\n\nBrowsing history\nWe do not track the user's browsing history. We realize the importance of privacy, so we make sure our extensions require only the minimum set of browser permissions to operate. In particular, during installation, it does not ask for the \"Read your browsing history\" or the \"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit\" permissions, both of which could be used to track the user's browsing history.\n\nText converted to speech\nWhen you select one of the standard text-to-speech voices, the speech synthesis occurs locally on your computer and is never sent to the internet. And neither the input text nor the synthesized speech are saved or stored on your computer.\n\nWhen you select one of the premium text-to-speech voices, the input text is sent to our cloud server for synthesis. The server may use your anonymized IP address and User-Agent data for purpose of analytics, abuse management, and service improvement. The server may cache the input text, as well as the synthesized speech, for short amounts of time as part of its normal operation; it does not save them to any type of permanent storage.\n\nGeolocation\nIf you select a voice that is synthesized on our server, your anonymized IP address may be used for geolocation for analytics purposes.\n\nIssue reporting and contact forms\nIf you use the in-app report-issue function or use the contact form on our support website, your comments and information may be kept in our support database for a maximum of 6 months.\n\nAnalytics\nThe extensions use Firefox Addons Store's built-in analytics. Firefox will collect basic extension usage data, including when the extension is installed, invoked, and uninstalled. The extension may also use its own counters to analyze usage patterns. This information is anonymized and do not present privacy concerns.","weeklyDownloads":3977,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"LSD Software","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13863253/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/199/199553.png?modified=1622133040","width":720,"height":540,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/199/199553.jpg?modified=1622133040","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.8299,"reviewCount":531,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/read-aloud/reviews/","updateDate":1741352032000},{"id":"CanvasBlocker@kkapsner.de","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-32.png?modified=1581849561","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-64.png?modified=1581849561","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-128.png?modified=1581849561"},"name":"CanvasBlocker","version":"1.11","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4413485/canvasblocker-1.11.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/","supportURL":null,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/","description":"Alters some JS APIs to prevent fingerprinting.","fullDescription":"This add-on allows users to prevent websites from using some Javascript APIs to fingerprint them.

The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension closes your Facebook tabs, deletes your Facebook cookies, and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container.

This WebExtension is inspired by Self Destructing Cookies. When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Keep the ones you trust (forever/until restart) while deleting the rest. Containers Supported","fullDescription":"Please don't use reviews for bugs, support request, or feature requests. Use GitHub instead.\n\nAs of Firefox 86, strict mode is not supported at this time due to missing APIs to handle the Total Cookie Protection. Also as of Firefox 103, standard mode has also enabled Total Cookie Protection. Use 'strict' mode if using pre-86, use standard mode for versions 86-102, or from version 103+ use the custom configuration and set cookie to 'cross site tracking cookies' option (not the cross-site cookies).\n\nBefore opening a GitHub Issue, please check the troubleshooting FAQ first. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nPermission Request Explanations\n- Access your data for all websites: CAD requests this to delete cookies and other site data for all sites\n- Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data: Ability to delete site data by domains.\n- Display notifications to you: Self explanatory.\n- Read and modify privacy settings: This setting has been removed since 3.4.0 and is kept here for historical reasons. Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD \"read and modify\" permissions, NO MODIFICATIONS are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed (and/or discarded) Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for domains\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist and core settings\n- Clear All Cookies and site data for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\n- Cleaning site data other than cookies within containers will have unintended side effects due to the current Web Extension API where attempting to clear a site data for one domain on a container will also clear that site data of the same domain on all containers.\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nBTC: 16km6pFV33S6kaeb8rCaDLZXUyo3uyVnsk","weeklyDownloads":1852,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"CAD Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12748480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189656.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189656.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Popup"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/185/185648.png?modified=1622132671","width":413,"height":135,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185648.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":413,"thumbnailHeight":135,"caption":"Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189657.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189657.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189658.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189658.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Expression Table"}],"contributionURL":"https://liberapay.com/CAD_Developers/?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.547,"reviewCount":666,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/reviews/","updateDate":1670829069000},{"id":"{9AA46F4F-4DC7-4c06-97AF-5035170634FE}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2/2257-32.png?modified=cfed2bac","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2/2257-64.png?modified=cfed2bac","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2/2257-128.png?modified=cfed2bac"},"name":"ImTranslator: Translator, Dictionary, TTS","version":"16.96","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4435026/imtranslator-16.96.xpi","homepageURL":"http://about.imtranslator.net/tutorials/presentations/imtranslator-translator-for-firefox/","supportURL":"http://about.imtranslator.net/tutorials/presentations/imtranslator-translator-for-firefox/","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imtranslator/","description":"COMPLETELY REDESIGNED TRANSLATOR FOR FIREFOX\nImTranslator translates text, words, webpages between more than 100 languages.\nNEW: Inline Translator, Dictionary, access to Google Translate, Microsoft Translator.
